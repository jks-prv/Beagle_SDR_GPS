B) How to use.
   I) Try to identify a signal on the radio:
      You will need to know the frequency you tuned to in kHz, and the
      time of the reception in UTC.
      Search for the frequency in the list. Check all entries for this frequency:
       - The listening time should fall inbetween the start and end times given for the broadcast.
       - The day of the week should match. (If none is given in the list, the broadcast is daily.)
       - Try to guess the language you hear, if you don't know it.
       - Try to estimate the probability of propagation. The last column gives you information about
         the transmitter site (if not, the transmitter is in the home country of the station.)
         The target-area code should give you a clue if the signal is beamed in your direction or not.
         If you are right in the target area, great. If you are "behind" it (from the transmitter's
         point of view) or inbetween, your chances are also good. If the line connecting transmitter
         and target area is perpendicular to the line connecting the transmitter to your location,
         chances are lower. They are also lower if the target area is very close to the transmitter,
         while you are far away.
      Still, all rules can be turned upside-down by propagation conditions. You might sit in a good
      direction but the waves may skip 80 kilometers above you in the ionosphere. Listed information
      may be wrong, misleading, or outdated. Transmitters may fail, be upgraded, or drift in frequency.
      Transmitter sites may change (for example, fire in the control room, hurricane tore the antenna
      down, and transmissions have all been redirected to the Bonaire transmitter). Broadcasters and
      transmitter operators may mix up programmes or tune to the wrong frequency.
      My lists will be useful for fast identification of many stations on the band, but in a number of
      cases it will be of no use to you or it may bring you to a wrong conclusion. NO WARRANTY in case
      of a wrong ID, an embarrasingly wrong log or reception report sent out etc.
      
      The ONLY 100% ID is that which you hear on the radio yourself. Even QSLs may be wrong.
      
   II) Find a broadcast you would like to hear:
      Make extensive use of the SEARCH and SORT functions of the computer programme which you use.

      For text-format files I use TextPad, a freely downloadable text editor.
      Software has been written by very nice colleages of us to display the files in a more convenient manner,
      namely:
      
      ShortwaveLog, by Robert Sillett, N3OEA, which you can find on http://www.shortwavelog.com/
      
      RadioExplorer, by Dmitry Nefedov, Russia, which you can find on http://www.radioexplorer.com.ru/
      
      EiBiView, by Tobias Taufer, hosted on my website, real-time browsing!

      GuindaSoft Lister, freely downloadable from 
      http://guindasoft.impreseweb.com/utile/utile.html
      Click on the column headers to sort first by time, then by language or station or however you
      wish. Try it out.

      Not to forget the software of the PERSEUS receiver.

C) Available formats.

Since B06, the fundamental database is a CSV semicolon-separated list that contains
all the broadcasts relevant during the season, even if only for part of it.

A program script is used to transfer these data into the frequency-sorted and the
time-sorted text file. These two are the ones that exclusively contain the currently
valid data (current at the time of creation which is given at the top of the file).

Naming of files is
sked-Xzz.csv for the CSV database, load this into EiBiView;
freq-Xzz.txt for the frequency-sorted text file;
bc-Xzz.txt for the time-sorted text file;
where Xzz stands for the current broadcasting season:
 X=A: Summer season
 X=B: Winter season
 zz:  Two-character number for the year. E.g.,
 A99: Summer season 1999
 B06: Winter season 2006/2007.
 
The change from A to B or from B to A usually coincides with the
change of clock to or from Daylight Saving Time / Summer Time in many parts of
the world. The U.S.A., however, decided to use Daylight Saving Time
for an even longer period, beginning in 2007.

A file called eibi.txt is the same as the freq file, copy this into
your Perseus directory to view the EiBi entries in that receiver's software.

Format of the CSV database (sked-):
The entries are separated by semicolons (;), so each line has to contain ten semicolons - not more, not less.
Entry #1 (float between 10 and 30000): Frequency in kHz
Entry #2 (9-character string): Start and end time, UTC, as two '(I04)' numbers separated by a '-'
Entry #3 (string of up to 5 characters): Days of operation, or some special comments:
         Mo,Tu,We,Th,Fr,Sa,Su - Days of the week
         1245 - Days of the week, 1=Monday etc. (this example is "Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday")
         1.Sa - First Saturday of the month
         1WeFr - First Wednesday of the month, repeated the following Friday
         Note: Vatican Radio counts major Catholic holidays as "Sunday"
         alt - Alternative frequency, not usually in use
         altFr - Alternating Fridays etc.
         harm - Harmonic signal (on multiples of the fundamental frequency)
         imod - Intermodulation signal (e.g., 17490 and 17650 on same transmitter produce 17330 and 17810)
         irr - Irregular operation
         Haj - Special broadcast for the Haj
         MF-15 - Monday through Friday, but only up the 15th day of each month
         Ram - Ramadan special schedule
         tent - Tentatively, please check and report your observations
         test - Test operation, may cease at any time
         15Sep - Broadcast only on 15 September
         LSB - Lower Side Band
         USB - Upper Side Band (default for utility voice transmissions)
Entry #4 (string up to 3 characters): ITU code (see below) of the station's home country
Entry #5 (string up to 23 characters): Station name
Entry #6 (string up to 3 characters): Language code
Entry #7 (string up to 3 characters): Target-area code
Entry #8 (string): Transmitter-site code
Entry #9 (integer): Persistence code, where:
         1 = This broadcast is everlasting (i.e., it will be copied into next season's file automatically)
         2 = As 1, but with a DST shift (northern hemisphere)
         3 = As 1, but with a DST shift (southern hemisphere)
         4 = As 1, but active only in the winter season
         5 = As 1, but active only in the summer season
         6 = Valid only for part of this season; dates given in entries #10 and #11. Useful to re-check old logs.
         8 = Inactive entry, not copied into the bc and freq files.
        90 plus the above = Utility station
Entry #10: Start date if entry #9=6. 0401 = 4th January. Sometimes used with #9=1 if a new permanent service is started, for information purposes only.
Entry #11: As 10, but end date. Additionally, the date of the most recent log can be noted in [brackets]. [0212]=Last heard in February 2012.

   Alternatively, ITU country codes may be used if the target area is limited to
   a certain country. This is often the case for domestic stations.
   
   IV) Transmitter site codes.
   One-letter or two-letter codes for different transmitter sites within one country.
   No such code is used if there is only one transmitter site in that country.
   
   The code is used plainly if the transmitter is located within the home country of the station.
   Otherwise, it is preced by "/ABC" where ABC is the ITU code of the host country of the transmitter site.
   Example: A BBC broadcast, relayed by the transmitters in Samara, Russia, would be designated as "/RUS-s".
   
   In many cases, a station has a "major" transmitter site which is normally not designated. Should this station
   use a different transmitter site in certain cases, they are marked.
   No transmitter-site code is used when the transmitter site is not known.
   
   Resources for transmitter sites include:
