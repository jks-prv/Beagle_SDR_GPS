For the Github commit log see here: https://github.com/jks-prv/Beagle_SDR_GPS/commits/master

v1.274  March 17, 2019
    Added URL parameter "keys=" to apply specified keyboard shortcut keys upon connection.
        Example: "keys=xyyys" would cause the control panel to be hidden ('x' key),
        top and label bars to be hidden ('yyy' keys) and spectrum display to appear ('s' key).
        The shift key can obviously be used (e.g. capital 'S' for waterfall auto-scale) but the
        control and option keys cannot. But this should not be a significant limitation as it only
        effects parameters which can be set in other ways (see below).

        The keys used to enter values and options into the frequency box cannot be entered using
        this new parameter. Use the existing "f=" URL parameter instead. Remember that you can
        directly set the zoom value using the f= parameter since the other components are optional
        e.g. f=usbz7 f=/750cwz12 f=z4
        
    Added URL parameter "wfm=min{,max}" to directly set waterfall colormap control values.
        Example: wfm=-90 (WF max value is unchanged) wfm=-120,-60 (changes both values)

v1.273  March 15, 2019
    URL parameter "abuf=min" for specifying the minimum length of the audio output buffer (in secs)
        can now optionally take the form "abuf=min,max" e.g. "abuf=0.6,1.2" for 0.6 to 1.2 seconds
        worth of buffering. With only min specified the default max is min * 3 which may be
        too much in some cases.

v1.272  March 14, 2019
    Added URL parameters "p", "prot" and "protected" (they are all equivalent) to force a
        password protected channel to be used when connecting. This is for the case of a Kiwi with
        a mix of password protected channels and publicly available channels without a password. 
        And you want to connect without decreasing the pool of public channels.
        
        Note that if you are connecting from the same local network as the Kiwi, and admin auto-login
        has been setup, this is counted as a connection from the password protected pool and you
        do not need to specify this parameter. So you would not need to specify the "prot"
        parameter for a Kiwi on your local network but you would need it for a Kiwi installed at
        a remote location. Or it would be needed by a group of users to access the private channel(s)
        without impacting the availability of the public pool.

v1.270, 271  March 5, 2019
    Step to next/previous DX label (filtered or not) using the following:
        Shift-and-alt/option j, i, or left/right arrow keys (i.e. hold both shift and alt/option)
            (shift-key alone and alt/option-key alone of these keys speedup the frequency step
            function these keys normally perform. See the keyboard shortcut help menu)
        Shift-click on control panel pan buttons (circled "<" and ">" icons)
    When label stepping the current mode and custom passband (if any) is set
    
    Automatically close filter panel when both fields are set empty.
    
    Fixed a bug where if filtering was in effect, and you edited a label, the results of the
        editing would not appear in the filtered results immediately.

v1.269  March 3, 2019
    Added DX label filtering. Type '@' keyboard shortcut or use entry in right click menu.

v1.267, 268  March 1, 2019
    In user tab on control panel show time remaining for both the inactivity timeout and connect
        time per ip address per 24 hours. Inactivity limit suffixed with "act" and resets when
        frequency, mode or zoom changed. Per-ip limit suffixed with "24h". Lesser of the two
        values is shown.
    The time limit exemption password can now be given in the URL, e.g. mykiwi:8073/?pwd=xyz
        Or use 'password=' in place of 'pwd='

v1.266  February 26, 2019
    Fixes for IQ balance function in IQ extension:
        Improved the user interface.
            Now warns to turn PLL mode OFF.
            Added "reset to default values" button.
            Show previous total IQ offset in addition to pending IQ offset adjustment.
        Discovered that 20 kHz mode (aka 3-channel mode) requires a different default IQ
            offset from 12 kHz (4/8-channel) mode.
        Added manual IQ offset adjustment to admin config tab. 

v1.265  February 18, 2019
    AM mode passband changed from 10 kHz to 9.8 kHz to avoid adjacent channel heterodynes in
        shortwave broadcast bands (by request).
    Show error pattern in LEDs if ip address was never assigned by DHCP or self-assignment.

v1.264  February 8, 2019
    Fixed a few buffer smashes.
    Got admin console control keys working again due to browser API changes (i.e. ^C ^D ^\)
    Better support for compiling and debugging with the LLVM/Clang address sanitizer (replaces valgrind)
    Log ipinfo and timezone servers used.

v1.263  February 5, 2019
    Fixed a problem with FAX extension. File saves show you results from the first save repeatedly
    (i.e. on subsequent saves) due to interactions with the browser cache.

v1.262  January 28, 2019
    Fixed audio CIC passband flatness (thanks Christoph).
    admin UI improvements: sdr.hu location and network auto-NAT fields.
    FSK crosshairs now follow waterfall panning.
    A few corrections to extension help button info.

v1.261  January 15, 2019
    Improved compatibility with recent Android versions.
        E.g. now working with Android 8.1.0, "Go" version.

v1.259, 260  January 12, 2019
    Added debugging for lock priority inversion problem.

v1.257, 258  January 9, 2019
    TDoA UI improvements:
        Added "4" button to zoom buttons at upper left. Zooms directly to level 4.
        Shift-clicking on the +/- buttons zooms by 3 levels instead of just one.
        Added distance scale (in km/m & miles/feet) to map at lower right.
        Added ruler function. Click on the "protractor" icon at lower right. Mouse cursor will
            change to cross symbol. Click on starting map position. Move mouse to ending map
            position and double-click to end ruler measurement. Or single-click to make
            intermediate measurement and continue. Click on icon to clear measurement.
            Don't use escape key as that will close the extension! (this may be fixed in the future)
    
    Admin GPS tab: now says "loading maps..." when display delayed due to map download process.

    By request: URL parameter "no_geo" to disable browser from determining and sending Kiwi the
        geolocation information of the connecting user.
        Use like other URL parameters, e.g. "mykiwi:8073/?f=5Mam&mute&no_geo"
        This will someday become one of the "user preferences" options.

v1.256  January 8, 2019
    TDoA
        Fixed bug introduced in v1.255 causing some TDoA solutions to fail.
        UI improvements:
            Mousing over markers makes them highlight in yellow.
            Marker overlap. When markers (Kiwis and reference stations) are located within 2 km
            of each other the selected marker(s) are separated by a small amount. This amount
            matters less in terms of location accuracy as the zoom level is increased.
            So it's a compromise between less overlap and marker accuracy.

v1.255  January 7, 2019
    TDoA improvements:
        20 and 12 kHz Kiwis can now be used together in computing TDoA solutions.
        Old TDoA algorithm is deprecated and no longer available from user interface.
        New "spiderfy" user interface for marker clusters:
            When the mouse moves over a marker cluster (circle with number representing the number
            of contained host or reference markers) a popup list used to be displayed.
            But this popup list was static and you couldn't selected an entry by clicking on it.
            Now a "spiderfied" view of the cluster is presented where the contents of the cluster
            pop-out and are linked back to the center of the cluster with white lines.
            While popped-out you can click on the host or reference marker to select it.

            To remove the spider mouse over another cluster or click on the map (outside a cluster).

            To revert to the old user interface start the TDoA extension from the URL specifying
            the "prev_ui:" parameter e.g. "mykiwi:8073/?ext=tdoa,prev_ui:" (note ending ":")
            
            There is still a problem of markers sometimes overlapping each other when selected as
            sampling stations or as the reference station.

v1.254  January 6, 2019
    TDoA: fixed spurious "no recent GPS timestamps" error after sampling.
    Better admin network DHCP/static-ip selection checking.
    Admin login: display a different message and client ip when no admin password set.
        Done as an aid in debugging the issue where people say they're getting a password prompt
        on new out-of-the-box Kiwis when a local network login should work.

v1.252, 253  January 4, 2019
    TDoA timing normalization for 20 kHz mode.

v1.251  January 1, 2019
    Add icon and "20 kHz" to sdr.hu status for Kiwis in new wide bandwidth mode.
    
    MSK100/200 mode for the iq display from Christoph. Useful for looking at VLF MSK signals
        when the Kiwi doesn't have GPS clock correction. Try MSK200 mode on these (and others)
        EU: DHO38, HWU(20.9), TFK(ISL), NSY, FUG(62.6), JXN?(NOR)
        NA: NAA, NLK, NLM4, NAU(PR)
        PAC: NWC(AUS), NPM(HI), NDT/NDI?(JPN), VTX?(IND)
        Use demod settings: AM mode, passband 50-100 Hz
        IQ extension settings: gain = auto-scale, density, mode = IQ, MSK200, pll_bw <= 5

v1.250  December 31, 2018
    Add 20 kHz wide audio bandwidth mode.
        A third entry to the list of FPGA configurations. See admin "mode" tab for details.
    
    Add Ethernet 10/100 speed select to admin network tab.
        The speed changes after a few seconds of delay (no Kiwi restart required).
        This allows you to be looking at a waterfall in another window and see if
        the Ethernet spurs (if present at your installation) improve or not.
        Be sure the device (router, switch) your Kiwi connects to supports 10 Mbps Ethernet.
    
    Accept 'k' & 'M' scaling suffixes in frequency and passband parameters.
        Examples: Type "/15k" in frequency box to get a 15 kHz wide passband. Or "/2.7k", "-5k,10k" etc.
        Use a URL of "...?f=7.4M/16.5k" to set a frequency of 7.4 MHz and passband of 16.5 kHz.
        Note uppercase 'M' since 'm' is already keyboard shortcut for mute.
        You can remember this because the 'M' in MHz is always capitalized whereas 'k' in kHz is not.
        Note also 'k' used to be paired with 'j' as the frequency up/down jog shortcut.
        Now the 'j' and 'i' keys are used (also 'J' and 'I' to jog faster).
        Using the 'i' key is actually more natural because it fits the placement of your
        index and middle fingers better than 'j' and 'k'.
        Finally, 'i' was previously used to select IQ mode. Now use 'q' instead.
        Type 'h' or '?' to see the complete keyboard shortcut help panel.

v1.249  December 11, 2018
    If applicable show remaining time of 24hr time limit in user lists
        (in orange text on both user tab and status tab of admin page).

v1.248  December 10, 2018
    Fix race condition in 24hr time limit code. Charge time from multiple connections.

v1.247  December 7, 2018
    Prevent bad sdr.hu configuration.

v1.246  December 6, 2018
    Added Christoph's GNSS Kalman filter. Spectacular improvement in position solutions.
        Accuracy is improved and outliers are removed (on the admin GPS tab the "solution"
        status indicator "S" will no longer flash red indicating a bad solution).
        Most importantly the filter allows solutions to be computed when there are fewer
        than 4 satellites being received (the usual requirement for an MLAT solution).
        This will significantly improve the amount of time a Kiwi is eligible for TDoA use.
        See Christoph's blog post for more details:
        hcab14.blogspot.com/2018/09/kiwisdr-gnss-position-solutions-using.html
    
    Brightness control of the 4 blue status LEDs added (see new menu in admin config tab).

v1.245  November 1, 2018
    Show message when extension is dynamically loading.
 
v1.243,244  October 25, 2018
    Security improvements.
 
v1.242  October 24, 2018
    Remove CIC compensation because it causes WSPR distortion.
 
v1.241  October 21, 2018
    Revert changes since v1.240 causing occasional audio pauses and/or static bursts.
 
v1.240  October 19, 2018
    Dynamically load extension code (Javascript & CSS).
        Part of changes to improve initial page load time.
    Admin GPS map: use new map provider.
    TDoA: add graticule overlay. Has bug of not always being visible.
    Reduction in disconnects when > 6 channels connected and non-Kiwi Linux tasks running.
        This is an improvement, but the problem is not completely solved.
 
v1.239  October 14, 2018
    User interface improvements:
        'x' and 'y' shortcut keys toggle control panel, top bar visibility respectively.
 
v1.238  October 7, 2018
    TDoA extension:
        Changed mapping provider. BETA TEST. There are known problems, but it is better
        than the currently broken Google map. Use "gmap:" in URL to use old Google maps,
        e.g. "?ext=tdoa,gmap:"
 
v1.237  October 2, 2018
    Fix bug causing server crash-loop on update if WSPR auto-run enabled.
 
v1.236  October 1, 2018
    Changed timezone lookup providers.
 
v1.235  September 30, 2018
    Christoph's fixes for clean web socket connection closing.
 
v1.234  September 29, 2018
    Increase receiver DDC channel NCO phase word width from 32 to 48 bits.
        This stops all rotation of (ground wave) LF/VLF signals on the IQ extension display
        caused by increased quantization of NCO phase for low receive frequencies when
        a phase word of only 32-bits is used.

v1.233  September 28, 2018
    Fixed precision bug in mixer NCO value computation.

v1.232  September 25, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        New checkbox to select Christoph's improved TDoA algorithm. Original algorithm still available.
            To select in URL use "new:" e.g. "... &ext=tdoa, ... ,new:,submit:"

v1.231  September 22, 2018
    Add "click to start" overlay now that Safari 12 implements auto-play restrictions.

v1.230  September 19, 2018
    CW decoder: add filter output graph with threshold indicator.
    Fix Google timezone lookups.

v1.229  September 18, 2018
    CW decoder extension improvements:
        Require 4 decoding errors before re-train. (previously just 1)
        Added error count indicator.
        Specifying extension argument fixes decoder filter frequency and disables passband tracking.
            e.g. my_kiwi:8073/?ext=cw,500
    In addition to specifying passband "/pbw" and "/lo,hi" in URL and frequency entry box
        can now also specify ":pbc" and ":pbc,pbw" to easily change passband center.
    Added event notification API for the benefit of CATSync.

v1.226,227,228  September 17, 2018
    CW decoder extension improvements:
        Realtime fixes.
        Added checkbox for "word space correction".
            Change when spacing between words is consistently wrong.
        Added checkbox for "threshold correction".
            Checking seems to help with weak signal decoding.
        Added a button which resets the code.
        Added a "train" indicator that lights when code speed training is active.

v1.225  September 16, 2018
    CW decoder extension fixes.

v1.224  September 15, 2018
    Added CW decoder extension.

v1.223  September 12, 2018
    CIC filter compensation via empirical measurement.
    Minor TDoA UI improvements.

v1.222  September 11, 2018
    Re-enabled the AM post-detector FIR filter after fixing the underlying problem as the
        FIR filter is needed to workaround the known issue with CIC filter droop.
    TDoA extension improvements:
        "rerun" button: reruns the TDoA calculation using the existing samples.
            Useful when you just want to adjust the map position/zoom or remove a
            station's samples from the list and then recalculate.
        If any of the TDoA result maps are selected when the submit or rerun buttons
            are pressed then the position/zoom of the result map is used for the new run.
            Previously only the Kiwi map position/zoom was ever used.
            

v1.220,221  September 9, 2018
    Added audio FFT in the waterfall/spectrum for those channels where the regular
        multi-level zoom waterfall/spectrum is not available.

v1.219  August 30, 2018
    Christoph's fix for web socket close.
    Update Galileo sat list.
    Admin control tab option to disable all waterfall/spectrum display.
        By request. This option saves Internet bandwidth.
        Doesn't include audio FFT waterfall which consumes no additional Internet bandwidth.

v1.218  August 20, 2018
    Solution for the GPS "diminishing fixes" problem.

v1.217  August 20, 2018
    Fixed negative passband values in URL.

v1.216  August 7, 2018
    All 12 GPS channels now support any satellite type (Navstar/QZSS/Galileo).
    Do URL redirect if configured and Kiwi is marked down.

v1.215  August 3, 2018
    New admin config parameters to set external ADC clock frequency and GPS correction.
    Other ADC clock control improvements in IQ extension and "cal ADC clock" menu item.
    Fix race causing incorrect inactivity timeouts under certain circumstances.
    Passband can be specified in the "f=" URL parameter, format same as frequency entry box.
        See: http://kiwisdr.com/quickstart/index.html#id-user-tune
        This is an alternative to specifying the passband alone with "pbw=" or "pb=" parameters.

v1.214  August 1, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        Fix for TDoA with a mix of RX4 and RX8 mode Kiwis (GPS timestamp offset).
        Get reference station list from kiwisdr.com instead of hardwired in code.
        Keep selected Kiwi and reference markers out of marker clusters.

v1.213  July 31, 2018
    RX8WF2 mode
        Fix detection of all channels busy.
        Added "no_wf" URL parameter to force non-waterfall channel to be used, e.g.
            my_kiwi:8073/?ext=wspr,40m&mute&no_wf
        In the users list option tab show our channel number in green to distinguish from others.

v1.212  July 30, 2018
    Beta test of RX8WF2 mode: more receiver channels.
        See the new "mode" tab on the admin page for details.

v1.211  July 25, 2018
    Fix TDoA channel limit bug.

v1.210  July 25, 2018
    Correct dictionary-order sort of extension names in lists and menus.
    TDoA extension improvements:
        Added reference station categories.
        Admin page extensions tab lets you limit number of channel used by TDoA service.
        Admin page security tab lets you disable sending GPS timestamps completely.
        Moved "TDoA ID" setting from sdr.hu tab to TDoA tab on extensions page
        Updated help info.

v1.209  July 22, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        When TDoA complete automatically switch to result map.
        Switch option bar to 'off' (and restore) when TDoA running. Obscures the map less.
        Option checkboxes moved to right of map display.
        Added checkboxes to show/hide reference stations and day/night overlay.
        Added more references stations.
    Fix passband width adjustment when passband is offset from carrier (i.e. ssb, cw)
    Use pointer cursor for menus and checkboxes.

v1.208  July 21, 2018
    Commas in frequency entry field work again (broken since keyboard shortcuts added).
    Can now quickly change passband via entry in frequency entry field:
        Type "freq/pbw" or just "/pbw" where pbw is the passband width in Hz
        or the low and high edges with "low,high".
        Examples:
        1234.56             set f=1234.56 as usual
        1234,56             set f=1234.56 using comma as decimal separator
        234.56/1200         set f=234.56 and pbw=1200 around current pb center
        /600                set pbw=600
        /300,3000           set pb=(300,3000) i.e. usb 2700 Hz wide
        7255/-2600,-300     set f=7255 and pbw=(-2600,-300) i.e. lsb 2300 Hz wide
    Facility added to load certain javascript asynchronously (e.g. Google maps).
    
    TDoA extension improvements:
        New URL parameter "submit:" that will automatically start TDoA on webpage load.
            e.g. ...?ext=tdoa,submit:,F1JEK,DL6ECS,SWL/JO21JN,DCF77
            There is a 6 second delay for the initial status inquiries to complete.
        6 character grid square used for ID instead of old "KiwiNNN" (Thanks Martin).
        Duplicate IDs distinguished by appending /N to the ID (N = 2,3,...)
        Multiple Kiwis at identical locations on map dithered slightly so all are visible.
        More reliable communications protocol with server should prevent hangs.
        Submit button changes to a stop button while TDoA running (feature may still have bugs).
        "Most likely position" marker now shown on result maps.
            This in addition to reference position if one has been specified.
        Most likely position lat/lon shown at panel top along with cyan Google map link.
            Triple-click on lat/lon value to copy/paste.
        Green link icon at panel top has URL with current TDoA extension configuration
            Right-click while hovered on link to create configuration bookmark or
            click to open in a new tab/window (less useful).
            Link is continuously updated as map is changed, host list changed etc.
        After sampling each host shows a download icon for the recorded .wav IQ file.

v1.207  July 17, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        Allow extension parameters in URL, e.g.
            ...?ext=tdoa,lat:49,lon:7.5,z:6,F1JEK,DL6ECS,DCF77
            Will zoom the map to specified lat/lon/zoom and select specified Kiwis and ref station.
            lat/lon/zoom is displayed at control panel upper right for reference.
        Cluster markers when they are too close together:
            Hover mouse over cluster for list of markers it contains.

    Fixed bug that reduced the frequency of GPS solutions under certain conditions.
    Include GPS good/fix counts in /status URL query.
    Add URL args to redirect URL, e.g. a connection to mykiwi:8073/?f=5000 will redirect to

    Added external ADC clock selection switch to config tab of admin page.
    Switch to using three new geolocation servers.

v1.190,191  May 10, 2018
    Added keyboard shortcuts. Press "h" or "?" to toggle a help list. Work in progress.
    IQ display extension now supports mPSK (BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK) carrier locking.
        See the Kiwi forum for more details.
    DX edit panel:
        1) New "extension" field. Place name of extension and associated parameters in this field
        and the extension will be started when dx label is clicked. Label turns magenta instead of
        yellow when you mouse over the label and an extension has been specified.
        Use ctrl/alt-click to skip starting extension and only select frequency as usual.
        Extension specification is the same as used in the URL "ext=" parameter. See documentation.
        2) New "passband" field. Format is a single number in Hz specifying the width of a
        symmetrical passband around the carrier (i.e. AM or DSB) or two numbers separated by a
        comma or space specifying the low and high passband offsets (e.g. "300, 700" for USB-CW)
    With the above two features you can create a dx label for a STANAG 4285 signal that specifies
        the proper 2400 Hz AM bandwidth (+/- 1200 around carrier) and then a label extension field
        of "iq,density,8PSK".
    FAX extension aligns entire image when shift-click is used.
        Also touch alignment now works on mobile devices.
    Escape key now closes extension and confirmation panels in all cases.

v1.176,177,178  Apr 18, 2018
    The Kiwi GPS now receives Galileo satellites in addition to Navstar and QZSS.
        A GPS antenna with restricted sky visibility will now have more satellites to choose from
        and should produce position/time solutions more often.
        Please consider attaching the GPS antenna to your Kiwi, especially if yours is a
        public Kiwi listed on sdr.hu  This will assist with ongoing HF direction finding experiments
        as well as serve as a source of frequency calibration for your Kiwi.
        Thanks to Christoph Mayer for important insight and bug fixes.
    Admin GPS tab now has Google map display.

        Added classic LMS denoiser and autonotch to audio tab. Filter controls on extension panel.
            The LMS filters are not a panacea for all filtering problems.
            They are tricky to adjust and don't work in all situations.
            The presets are a work-in-progress.
        Added audio mute icon/button to right of spectrum button (renamed "Spec" to fit).
        WF option tab
            Number after "WF" on option tab button is current zoom level, e.g. "WF10"
            "Auto Scale" button: automatically sets WF min/max.
                Best when there are a range of signal levels.
            "Slow Dev" button: Use when you have audio drops on slow mobile devices (e.g. old iPad).
                Uses single color in spectrum and slower waterfall speed.
            "colormap" & "contrast" menus: beginnings of waterfall colormap control. Work-in-progress.
            "spec filter" menu: variable spectrum time constant so decay time can be varied.
        Add URL parameter to set initial waterfall speed:
            wf={0, off, 1, 1hz, s, slow, m, med, f, fast} e.g. kiwi:8073/?wf=1hz
        Fixed problem with NDB database lookup not working.
