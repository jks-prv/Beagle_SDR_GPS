v1.708,709  November 23, 2024
    Github repo rebase test on a limited set of Kiwis.
    For everyone else this update does nothing (except blacklist update below).
    
    IP blacklist update. (thanks ArturPL, WA2ZKD)

v1.703,704,705,706,707  November 2, 2024
    The binary install mechanism now covers a greater range of Debian minor releases numbers.
        On on BBG/BBB Debian 8.5 - 8.11 and 11.9 - 11.11 are covered by this release.
    
    Iframe now allows a virtual alias name to be added to the extension menu.  (thanks DF6DBF)
    ALE scanning no longer continuously resets the connection inactivity timer. (thanks HB9TMC)
    Fixed installation of /bin/nc (netcat) used by KMtronic-UDP antenna switch. (thanks F5LFE)
    Update to satellite table to reflect recent Galileo changes. (thanks F4FPR)

v1.702  October 23, 2024
    Binary updates:
        After this release is installed Kiwis become eligible to receive binary updates.
        That is, a full recompile from source code will not be required each time an update occurs.
        So an update should take a few minutes instead of 20-30.
    
        This will only occur if a binary file in the bin/ directory exists with the correct
        Debian version number (e.g. 8.5, 11.9) and platform name (e.g. BBG_BBB, BBAI, BBAI_64).
        For example, bin/kiwid_v1.702_D11.9_BBG_BBB.bin will be copied to /usr/local/bin/kiwid
        if validated. Otherwise recompilation from source will occur as a fallback.
        
        As a first test, for this release binaries will be installed for the default Kiwi-2
        configuration: Debian 11.9 and BBG/BBB. This will also apply to BBG/BBB-based Kiwi-1s that
        run D11.9. Setups with other characteristics will build from sources as usual.

    In the frequency entry field fixed "set waterfall frequency" notation, e.g. #7020
    Type the "H" key (capital H) for more information about "#". (thanks stan)
    
    FSK extension:
        Added 50 Hz to shift menu.
        Added HFGCC VLF freqs to DX community database.
            (thanks NEET INTEL via x.com/neetintel/status/1837600716644389113)

    Admin page:
        Update tab: Don't update after a restart, wait for overnight update window.
            Only applies to default set by first time software installs, i.e. won't disturb any
            manual change you may have made. (requested by KiwiSDR NZ manufacturing team)
        DX tab: Fixed missing entry in "Default DX label database" menu. (thanks ukoda)

v1.700,701  September 17, 2024
    User interface:
        Adjusting the passband edges should now work in most cases on mobile devices.
        If it doesn't remember that there are other ways to adjust the passband including sliders
        on the audio tab.
    
        When adjusting the passband edges if the cursor wanders above or below the frequency scale
        adjustment will continue to work. However the tooltip displaying the passband numeric
        values continues to only appear when the cursor is positioned over the passband edge.
        Remember that you can only adjust the edges when zoomed in far enough that the passband
        color is green instead of yellow.
        
        On narrow screen devices top bar now scrolls horizontally so all items can be accessed.
        
        Mobile devices: sliding the passband to the screen edges causes the frequency scale to pan.
        
        FT8/WSPR:
            Added QO-100 satellite frequencies to extension and autorun menus.
            Added FT8/WSPR V/UHF DX label entries to community database.
        
        When the frequency offset is setup for operation with a greater than 1 GHz downconverter
        the frequency entry box overflows due to the extra digit(s) displayed. There wasn't really
        a good solution for this. Except that now if the cursor starts out inside the box the
        keyboard left/right arrow keys will scroll left/right across the digits. As opposed to
        tuning the current frequency as the left/right arrow keys normally do.
    
        ALE extension:
            Added "UN MINURSO" to milcom frequency list. (thanks M0HGK)
            Added "MOROCCAN AF/Civil/Police/Navy" services to milcom frequency list. (thanks Mark W)

    Admin interface:
        The top bar (tab selection) and any status/error messages are now fixed at the top of the
        page and no longer participate in any scrolling. This eliminates, for example, the page
        "jumping back" to the top when you change a setting that requires a restart.
    
        Config tab:
            New menu "Frequency scale presets" has some pre-defined values that automatically puts
            the correct entry in the "Frequency scale offset" field. For example, the menu entry
            "144 => 28 (2m)" puts the value 116000 in the offset field which would map 144-148 MHz
            to 28-32 MHz (assuming 32 MHz mode selected). We can add to this menu as necessary.
        
        Network tab:
            Better user interface behavior during "DHCP/static" and "Auto add NAT" changes.
        
        Extensions tab:
            WSPR option "Log spot debug info?" now produces a correct debug message in the log.
            For example, WSPR UPLOAD: wsprnet.org said: "1 out of 1 spot(s) added"

v1.699  August 25, 2024
    User interface:
        When recalling from the frequency memory using the ctrl-1 ctrl-2 ... ctrl-9 shortcut keys the
        recalled frequency is no longer pushed on top of the stack. The stack now remains unchanged.
        So that subsequent uses of the same ctrl-N key recalls the same frequency.
        
        Mobile devices: When right-click menu is open a single tap in the waterfall will close the
        menu without performing any action. Works the same as the existing double tap in the
        waterfall.
    
    Admin interface:
        Show warning when attempting to connect using device with a small screen.
    
    Bug fixes:
        Fixed problem causing public registration not to work sometimes.
        Always allow on-demand SNR measurement when the antenna switch is disabled. (thanks G4WIM)

v1.697,698  August 9, 2024
    Fixed problem with iPads where onscreen keyboard pops up with every button press.
    This was due to Apple making non backward-compatible changes to the browser "user agent" string.
    You should no longer need the workaround of adding "/?m" or "/?mobile" to the URL.

    Fixed frequency (and offset) shown in monitor mode panel.

v1.696  August 5, 2024
    Antenna switch:
        Progress trying to get the frequency offset settings of the admin config (global)
        and antenna switch (per-antenna) to play nice with each other.
        
            In the antenna description area of the admin > extensions > antenna switch page there is
            a new menu called "Mode" for setting what kind of frequency offset and mixer injection
            should be applied when each antenna is selected.
        
            "no offset" means nothing about the offset will be changed and the
            "frequency scale offset" field to the right will be ignored.

            "offset" means the frequency scale offset will be applied and user connections will be
            reloaded (and autoruns restarted) to account for the change. Low-side mixer injection
            for any downconverter is assumed for the "offset" mode.
        
            "hi side inj" is also an offset mode but sets up tuning of the Kiwi mixers to accomodate
            downconverters using high-side mixer injection.
        
            The mode menu will be preset based on your pre-v1.696 settings. But you should review it
            to make sure it is set to do what you want.
        
        The "cURL command arguments" field allows an arbitrary cURL command to be run when an
        antenna is selected. This could be a command causing a network-enabled downconverter to
        change setup such as frequency/band etc. More info: kiwisdr.com/info#id-antsw
        (thanks N6GN)
        
        SNR measurements are now skipped if the antenna is grounded because no users are connected
        (if that option has been enabled) or if in thunderstorm mode. However, after a restart the
        initial SNR measurement (to set the values on the user page and optional public listing)
        is performed before any antenna grounding takes place. Also, an error is shown if forced
        SNR measurement is attempted via the "/snr?meas" URL or "Measure SNR now" button on the
        admin control tab if the antenna is grounded. (thanks Stefan)
    
    Admin console: Option on admin security tab restricting admin console to local network
    connections only has been replaced with a new mechanism: See kiwisdr.com/info/#id-opt-dot
    for details. (thanks LA6LU)
    
    Admin DX tab: Fixed problem where changes to non-DX label info (e.g. band bar info) was not
    being seen by user connections consistently. (thanks Nhosker)
    
    Added new LED pattern if communication with FPGA fails. See kiwisdr.com/info for details.
    Primarily a Kiwi manufacturing aid.

v1.695  July 25, 2024
    Antenna switch:
        If in auto aperture mode an antenna change now causes an auto scale since the new antenna
        might have a significantly different gain.
        
        Arduino-based backends now correctly turn the antenna selection buttons green.
        
        Currently, the selected antenna's "frequency scale offset" field can conflict with the
        frequency scale offset set elsewhere. E.g. on the admin config tab or via a URL parameter
        or the right-click menu. Example: The default antenna has an offset of zero (HF) but the
        admin config tab offset is 140000 kHz (2m). As a stopgap you can now enter an antenna
        offset value of "-1" (minus one) and no offset change will occur as antennas are changed.
    
    WSPR/FT8:
        Autoruns are restarted when frequency offset is changed.
        
        Added UHF/VHF frequencies to FT8 extension and autorun menus.
        Including 40680 kHz (8m) for both.
    
    User tab: Added menu to reverse sense of wheel/trackpad direction.

v1.694  July 20, 2024
    New passband adjustment methods:
        If you scroll the audio tab down a bit you'll see it now has passband adjustment sliders.
        This is especially useful for mobile devices where most of the desktop mechanisms for
        passband adjustment don't apply. Very small screens, like phones, are difficult sometimes
        to touch the round part of the slider if two of them are close together. What you can do
        instead is touch the line part of the slider to make it jump to that position. Now it'll be
        easier to touch the round part and begin sliding the control smoothly.
        
        The spectrum passband marker (if it is being shown) now allows you to click-drag its outer
        edges to adjust the passband. Just as you would click-drag the sloping parts of the
        green passband graphic on the frequency scale. Hover over the outer edges of the passband
        marker. The cursor shape will change and the passband edge value and bandwidth will be
        shown. Now click and drag to adjust the passband.

    Mouse wheel tuning: (thanks PSO, G8JNJ, et al)
        The mouse wheel can now tune the frequency as well as adjusting the zoom.
        The right-click menu has a new entry controlling whether tune or zoom is the default.
        This setting is remembered in browser storage for the next time this Kiwi is visited.
        Depressing the wheel button while moving the wheel will temporarily select the opposite
        action, e.g. zooming if the wheel is set for tuning. This also applies to laptop trackpads
        that been configured for mouse wheel emulation, e.g. two finger up/down swipe.
        
        Frequency tuning step size: When wheel tuning the same modifier keys work as with the
        tuning shortcut keys (i.e. 'j', 'i', left-arrow, right-arrow). Namely, of the three tuning
        rates as shown by hovering over the - - - + + + buttons the slowest rate (typically 10 Hz)
        is selected by using no modifier key. The middle rate with the shift key and the fastest
        rate using the control or alt/option key.
        
        In lieu of the modifier keys there is also a simplistic two-speed detection of the wheel
        velocity. If the wheel is moved quickly enough it "locks" into moving at the fastest rate.
        It continues at that rate, even if the wheel is moved more slowly, until some time after
        the wheel stops. The passband color turns orange until the fast rate unlocks.
        If "snap to nearest" from the right-click menu is enabled then the fastest tuning rate is
        always used.
        
        Refinement of the two-speed algorithm is going to take some effort. Unfortunately there is
        no way for Javascript code to determine the characteristics of the actual wheel/trackpad
        device (DPI, sensitivity etc). So the control panel user tab has some presets and fields
        where you can alter some parameters. We can add new presets as experience is gained with
        various mouse wheel types.
        
        There are currently two presets and a "custom" menu entry 
        
        All of this assumes the cursor is positioned in the waterfall or spectrum. As before the
        mouse wheel modifies the passband if the cursor is on the frequency scale (in combination
        with the modifier keys mentioned above).

    Right-click menu:
        When the right-click menu is opened, and you decide you don't want to make a menu selection,
        the menu can now be dismissed by right clicking again (or single clicking) anywhere.
        Previously the most convenient way was to use the escape key. But this of course doesn't
        exist on mobile devices.
        
    WSPR extension spots will now upload again to wsprnet.org (thanks Nate, et al)
    
    Operating Information document: (kiwisdr.com/info)
        A description of all the query/control URLs has been added: kiwisdr.com/info#id-urls
        A few more of the available mobile gestures are described: kiwisdr.com/info#id-user-mobile
    
    User names composed of certain UTF-8 characters and lengths: (thanks OZ6F, RZ3DVP)
        1. Can no longer cause the admin users tab to stop displaying.
        2. Are now correctly shown in the admin log and system log.
    
    Antenna switch: (thanks S57RM, N8OOU, SM0OHC, et al)
        Arduino Netshield backend script: Increased curl timeout value from 2 to 4 seconds per
        suggestion by N8OOU. Note that until recently the timeout value had always been 1 second.
        It was changed to 2 seconds when the antenna switch code was integrated into the Kiwi server
        to match all the other backend script curl timeout values.
        
        Implemented queued delivery of commands to backend scripts. Should help with switches that
        are slow to respond. Tested by introducing an artificial 5 second delay into the Beagle-GPIO
        backend. Seems to work including with antenna mixing.
        
        Added a new admin setting: "Ground antennas when no users connected?" This is opposed to the
        previous behavior where if none of the "Default antenna" checkboxes were ticked then
        grounding of the antenna was performed when there were no users. But the first user to
        connect had to select an antenna (assuming users even had permission to do so).
        Now the grounding of antennas when there are no users and the specification of a default
        antenna are decoupled. If no-user grounding is in effect the default antenna will be
        selected when the first user connects. This is useful for example if you have a Kiwi where
        you'd like to keep the antennas grounded when the Kiwi is not in use
        (for lightning/static protection).
        
        If the user page needs to be reloaded because a selected antenna specifies a new frequency
        offset (e.g. going from HF to 2 meters) then the user page will be reloaded without
        requiring a confirmation. I.e. the notification box shown no longer has an "OK" button.
        The page simply reloads after a few seconds.
        
        Fix bug causing value of "Deny antenna mixing?" setting not to be saved across page reloads.
        
        Install netcat utility needed by kmtronix-UDP switch backend script.

        New shell alias "aah" to see all antenna switch frontend script aliases.    
    
    Admin config tab: (thanks Tremolat, G8JNJ, Ben, et al)
        New checkbox "Show user names to user connections". When checked will show "(private)" in
        place of usual user name displayed in the user tab of the main control panel. The user name
        is still shown on the admin status tab and /users URL query.
        
        New "initial value" menus for audio compression, display setup and option bar.
        (thanks HB9TMC, N6GN)
        
        By special request: Checkbox below WF cal slider to disable the automatic correction
        that is applied to the WF-min slider (3 dB per zoom step). It is not recommended that you
        set this option as it causes undesirable results. But it also provides a good learning
        opportunity why 3 dB correction is needed every time the WF bandwidth changes by 2x.
        Think SSB vs CW filters and why a narrower filter has a lower noise floor.
    
    Admin webpage and public tabs: (thanks ZL2LD)
        In an effort to simplify things there has been a general rearrangement and elimination of
        duplicate fields on the webpage and public tabs:
        
        1) The lat/lon, grid square and altitude fields have been removed from the public tab.
        When publicly registering a Kiwi these values are now taken from the webpage tab where they
        were duplicated. So there is now only one place where you need to set these values.
        See below for an explanation of the new "continuous update" feature.
        
        2) The admin email and antenna fields have moved to the webpage tab where they more
        properly belong.
        
        3) There remain two separate "location (name)" fields on the webpage and public tabs.
        Because you may want different location content to appear on the user page top bar
        versus what's displayed on your rx.kiwisdr.com public listing.
    
    Marine mobile grid square and lat/lon tracking: (thanks S50SVM/MM)
        All of the lat/lon and grid square fields now have the ability to be continuously updated
        by the GPS. So this includes the fields on the admin webpage tab as well as the FT8 and WSPR
        extension tabs. Previously this only existed for the WSPR tab. Although all the grid and
        lat/lon fields had (and continue to have) a button to do a one-time update from GPS.
        
        Setting continuous update will cause the values displayed on the user page top bar,
        rx.kiwisdr.com public listing, /staus query etc to update as the GPS returns a new location.
        In addition the updated values are used for FT8 and WSPR spots.
        
        For FT8/WSPR autorun when continuous update is active the grid is added to all the user
        lists where the decode count is shown. So for example in the user tab the previous
        "(N decoded)" becomes "(N decoded, GRID)". And when preemption is enabled for an autorun
        "(N decoded, preemptable)" becomes "(N decoded, GRID, pre)".

    SNR measurement:
        Measuring SNR on-demand will now work even though the periodic "SNR measurement interval"
        setting on the admin control tab is set to "disable". On-demand means the "Measure SNR now"
        button on the admin control tab or use of the "/snr?meas" control URL.
    
    Fixed the anti-HFDL monitoring countermeasure so it does not exclude the 80m ham band.

v1.687,688  June 25, 2024
    Automatically rebuild proxy configuration file when necessary.

v1.686  June 6, 2024
    If the auto proxy configuration needs to be restored after a re-flash then the admin password is
    now set to the Kiwi serial number. Previously the admin password restored to being blank which
    prevented the proxy URL from working to connect to the admin page (even from the local network).

    Antenna switch: Added backend script initialization error checking.

v1.684,685  May 31, 2024
    Antenna switch:
        If switch selector set to disabled no default antenna commands are sent to previously
            selected switch. (thanks N8OOU)
        Setting thunderstorm mode should now override default antenna actions.
        Custom backend scripts can now be placed in /root/kiwi.config and will be found provided
            the name conforms to the standard "ant-switch-backend-(name)" convention. (thanks DL3LED)

v1.683  May 30, 2024
    Antenna switch: Fixed problems with Arduino Netshield backend script. (thanks N8OOU)

    CAT interface: Removed newline characters (\r\n) from end of each transmitted CAT string
    because it was reported to cause problems with some CAT software. (thanks DF6DBF)
    
    DX community database: UNID FSK signal at 61.84 is Inskip GBR. (thanks HB9TMC)

    Added entries to satellite table for Galileo gsat0227 and gsat0225 launched 2024-04-28 and
    currently under commissioning. (thanks F4FPR)

    We have now formally purchased a license to use the Kiwi logo from Hayes Roberts at
    bluebison.net. Previously we had an informal agreement with Hayes where he allowed us to use
    the logo provided we always included the domain text "bluebison.net" wherever the logo was used.
    By purchasing a licence we can now remove the text and make uses of the logo look a bit cleaner.
    Big thanks to Hayes for giving the KiwiSDR its logo identity recognized by SDR enthusiasts
    around the world.

v1.682  May 19, 2024
    Fixed problem that prevented the new ipset+iptables blacklist filtering from actually working.
    Filtering was occurring (less efficiently) in the Kiwi server instead. (thanks Stefan HB9TMC)
    
    Fixed problem related to the restoration of the auto proxy configuration after a re-flash.

v1.681  May 16, 2024
    Antenna switch: If the "Switch to default antenna when no users connected?" option is set,
    and none of the "Default antenna" checkboxes are selected, then the switch device will be sent
    the command to ground all antennas. What this actually does depends on the switch hardware and
    the functioning of the switch backend script.
    
    If auto aperture mode is enabled and adjusting the waterfall min/max values this will no longer
    cause browser focus to be taken away from selected elements like input fields and menus.

v1.680  May 12, 2024
    Mobile improvements:
        Protection against the "- - - + + +" icon auto repeat continuing to repeat after you're
        no longer touching the icon.
        
        Disabled iOS browser "double tap zoom" and "hold-to-copy panel" features that interfered
        with Kiwi buttons and icons in some cases.

    For KiwiSDR 2 and later, the automatic proxy service configuration is restored after re-flashing
    with the latest re-flash image. This means you can once again access the Kiwi with the URL
    (serial number).proxy.kiwisdr.com after a re-flash just as you could when the Kiwi was new
    out-of-the-box.

v1.679  May 10, 2024
    Fixed CIC compensation filter gain for 3-channel mode.
    Fixed frequency sorting of EiBi database.
    Added initial phase correction to timecode extension. Time stations should sync now in all cases.

v1.678  May 8, 2024
    Admin page:
        New menu "Power on restart delay (secs)" on network tab. Allows adjustment of the time delay
        the Kiwi server waits after a Beagle/Debian restart as would be experienced after a
        power fail recovery. This delay allows for example network equipment such as routers to
        fully boot and stabilize before the server attempts to start things like the proxy service
        (which might otherwise fail to start if there is no network connectivity).
        The item formerly in this spot "Prevent multiple connections from the same IP address"
        has moved to the control tab as a new checkbox item.

v1.677  May 5, 2024
    Click-hold the frequency step buttons "- - - + + +" for auto repeat.

    Fixed various issues with auto aperture mode:
        When the waterfall was panned or scrolled too many requests to adjust the aperture piled up.
        If the strongest signals were fading significantly this caused the noise floor displayed to
        bounce up and down unnecessarily. Now the aperture should adjust only once per pan/zoom.
        
        To help keep the noise floor displayed in a darker colormap color capped the WF min/max
        delta to >= 50 dB.
        
        Added a second auto-scale button (when aperture averaging mode is "off") so you don't
        have to scroll up to get to the usual auto-scale button at the top of the WF tab.
    
    Fixed frequency undo/redo (i.e. typing shift-return). Didn't work properly in 10 Hz
    frequency display mode.
    
    Improved wording of password-related messages in the log when a user connects.

    Added shell alias "cl" for cleaning (reducing size of) the Debian system logs.
    Same as "clean logs" button in admin console tab.

v1.676  May 2, 2024
    Trigger immediate SNR measurement via /snr/?measure URL option. (thanks scratchmoney)

    Admin connect tab:
    Remove any attempt to include a port number in the DUC domain name field.
    Including a port number causes an invalid domain preventing any DUC-based connections.
    The port number is similarly removed from the "Domain Name" and "specified IP" fields.

    Show correct "reason disabled" message to active connections when the admin control tab
    "Enable user connections?" is set to "No". (thanks Kai DJ9KAI)
    
    DX labels:
        Community database: Change SSTV entries < 10 MHz USB to LSB. (thanks Richard VK2SKY)
        EiBi database: update from A23 to A24. (thanks Jeff N3EDS)
    
    Fixed broken "Owner/Admin" email link in user control panel stat tab.

v1.675  April 26, 2024
    Antenna switch:
        Added support for 3 and 7 antenna selectors for newer LZ2RR MS-V2 WiFi controller.
            Backend is called ma-s[37]a-web. Note: the s7a is different from the older ms-s7-web
            backend which controls an older version of the 7 antenna switch. This older version
            supported antenna mixing which the newer MS-V2 controllers do not.
            More info: forum.kiwisdr.com/index.php?p=/discussion/comment/18703/#Comment_18703
        Fixed bug in kmtronic and kmtronic-udp switch code. Should work now.
    
    From a user connection can open admin page with '~' shortcut key or button in "user" tab.
    DX labels can specify all former extensions: ant_switch, noise_blanker, noise_filter, waterfall.
    Spectrum passband marker now redraws correctly when browser window resized. (Thanks Paul)
    "ip" shell alias changes to "ipa" so as not to conflict with /sbin/ip program. (Thanks ON3RVH)

v1.674  April 24, 2024
    Antenna switch:
        Antenna selection specified in the DX label extensions field now works correctly.
        It is also possible to specify an antenna selection and an extension together, e.g.
        "ant,1&wspr,30m" "FT8,*&ant=loop" etc. Just as you would in a URL.
        "ant," and "ant=" are equivalent.

    WSPR extension now uses the same mechanism to upload wsprnet.org spots as WSPR autorun.
    This means the admin page, WSPR tab "Log spot debug info?" option works for both the extension
    and auto run modes. Unfortunately wsprnet.org doesn't seem to be currently sending any spot
    upload diagnostic information as it has done in the past.
    
    Admin config tab:
        RF attn slider is disabled for KiwiSDR 1 systems. This prevents the "Attn" annunciator from
        incorrectly appearing in the S-meter.

v1.672,673  April 23, 2024
    Integrated antenna switch fixes/improvements:
        API changes for antenna switch backend scripts. If you have a private script please review
            the scripts in Beagle_SDR_GPS/pkgs/ant_switch/backends to see the changes.
        Lower switching latency for MS-SnA-WEB switches as a result of API changes.
        Added support for LZ2RR MS-S5A-WEB and MS-S6A-WEB switches.
        New setting "disable" for switch device.
        Fixed problems with default antenna selection when no users connected.
        Backend scripts can indicate that antenna mixing is not supported (e.g. MS-SnA-WEB switches)
        Removed debugging prints. No longer appear in log.

v1.670,671  April 16, 2024
    Fixed various problems with the new scheme of storing configuration information in JSON instead
        of via URL encoding.
    
    Due to community pushback, no longer enabling the new name/callsign entry panel by default.
        If you want it then enable it via the checkbox on the admin control tab.

    Admin console tab: added "clean logs" button you can use in case the updates are failing due
        to lack of filesystem free space. If there is important info in the logs you want to keep
        (e.g. WSPR/FT8 spots) please backup the log files before cleaning them.
        Use the "disk free" button to see how much available filesystem space there is.
        You need maybe 400 MB free to do an update.

v1.668,669  April 15, 2024
    KiwiSDR Android app now working again.
    
    In sig gen extension self-test mode always switch to CW mode so self-test carrier is
        being accurately measured by the S-meter.

    Admin "users" tab should now display IPv6 addresses and also load somewhat faster.
    
    DX labels with embedded newlines ('\n') should now display correctly.
    
    Shift/Ctrl/Alt-click of zoom in/out and page up/down icons work again in audio FFT mode
        (bandwidth adjust and jump-to-nearest-label functions).
    
    Don't enable the admin "require name/callsign" option by default.

v1.666,667  April 12, 2024
    Extensions moved to main control panel so they can be used while another extension is in use:
        Antenna Switch extension => RF tab
        Waterfall extension => WF tab
        Noise Blanker/Filter extensions => Audio tab

        Those three tabs, RF/WF/Audio, now scroll vertically to accomodate the new content.
        
        To avoid confusion all the previous methods of accessing those former extensions are still
        available. So they continue to appear in the "extension" menu even though selecting them
        now simply jumps to their respective control panel position.
        Your existing bookmarks selecting an antenna will still work, e.g. kiwi:8073/?ext=ant,loop
        even though there is now a simplified format: kiwi:8073/?ant=loop
        
        Because mouse wheel (and trackpad emulation of that) will now cause scrolling of the
        RF/WF/Audio panel content you must now hold shift while the cursor is positioned over a
        slider to get the sliders to adjust using the mouse/trackpad (the prior behavior).

    The antenna switch has been integrated into KiwiSDR codebase to make the above change possible.
    My thanks to the author Kiwi Karvonen, OK1KK, for agreeing to this change.
    The antenna switch frontend & backend scripts have not changed. But now live in the directory
    /root/Beagle_SDR_GPS/pkgs/ant_switch instead of /root/extensions/ant_switch
    If you had the extension installed and configured the settings will be carried over to the
    Kiwi version. Backend selection and configuration has been added to the admin extensions page.
    As changes are made to the admin config they are immediately reflected on the new antenna switch
    area of the RF tab. No restarting is required anymore. The changes are significant enough that
    there will likely be bugs in the new scheme.


    The following improvements are based on suggestions made by the Kiwi community. Thanks everyone!
    
    Waterfall tab (WFn) has a new entry called "Spec RF passband marker".
    Similar to other SDR programs, when enabled this shows a transparent rectangle in the RF spectrum
    that is the width of the passband. Color adjustment, including transparency, via a color picker.
    Color is saved in browser storage. More marker improvements are planned, like being able to
    adjust the passband width by dragging the edges of the marker.
    
    Admin page:
        New checkbox on control tab: "Require name/callsign entry when connecting".
        Forces the user to enter a non-blank entry before a new connection will proceed.
        Not shown again since the name/callsign is now in browser storage for this Kiwi.
        
        RF attn slider on the admin config tab is now defined as the attenuation value preset
        on server startup. When a connection is made from a user that has attenuator adjustment
        permission, and has an attn value saved in browser storage, the storage value will be used.
        The intent here is to provide a global default attenuation value when there are only users
        connected who do not have attenuator adjust permission. Such as when the Kiwi owner/admin
        knows a few dB is required to prevent significant ADC overload.

        Admin password save:
        On the admin security tab is a new switch "Save admin password in browser local storage?"
        Note that browser storage is not the same as browser cookies in that local storage values
        are not included in every web request as cookies are. Hence using local storage to save
        the admin password is a better balance of security/convenience (but also note that cookies
        are now gone as described below).
        
        URL tab select:
        You can now specify an admin tab to select in the URL, e.g. my_kiwi:8073/admin?dx
        or my_kiwi:8073/admin?ext,ant to select the antenna switch submenu on the extensions tab.
        The names can be a case-insensitive substring of the full tab/menu names.
        So /admin?e,w to select the Extensions > WSPR submenu.
        
        Map GPS resolution:
        The webpage and public tabs had a button called "set from GPS" that would fill-in the
        map/location fields with a lat/lon value computed by the GPS (if available).
        The single button has been replaced with two: "lo res" and "hi res".
        "lo res" works as before, giving only two significant digits of lat/lon.
        A very rough location designed to protect your privacy.
        The new "hi res" button gives the full 6-digits of resolution the GPS computes.
        A warning is displayed when using this option telling you your precise location will be
        revealed on map.kiwisdr.com and the [map] link at the top of the user page.
    
        The webpage tab now allows customization of the user README/welcome panel (the panel with a
        violet color) and also the password panel shown (if any) when a user connects.
        If you make the customization entry empty the default text is restored.
    
        There is additional error checking on the connect tab "Domain name" and "Specified IP" fields.
        A domain name entry is looked up with DNS and an error displayed if the domain is not found.
        An invalid IP address specification will also show an error message.
        
        A new config tab checkbox controls if the geolocated city for a user connection will be shown.
        
        New admin tab "Users":
        Presents a list of all user connections since the server was last started.
        Essentially a consolidation of the "ARRIVED" and "LEAVING" log messages.
        A new entry appears when a user connects. And the "connected" time updates when a user leaves.
        Users with the same name/callsign connecting from different IP addresses are shown in a
        sublist, revealed by clicking an icon that will appear. Column sort options available.
        One of the intended uses is to more conveniently spot new undesirable "bot" connections and
        add them to the IP address blacklist.
        
        A new webpage tab checkbox allows centering of the top bar splash photo.
    
        The admin connection lockout period after restart (message: "Database update in progress")
        has been eliminated. (thanks Christoph for recommending Linux "ipset")
    
    New keyboard shortcut keys:
        '$' toggles 1 Hz frequency readout. Also added a new entry in the right-click menu.
        '%' toggles tuning lock (existing entry in the right-click menu).
        'R' switches to RF tab.
    
    Added AM wide mode. AM mode button now toggles AM => AMN => AMW => AM ...
    AMW default passband values available on the admin config tab.
    
    "Measure SNR now" button on admin control tab now shows result values next to the button.
    User and admin status page SNR values are now updated promptly.

    When the cursor hovers over the "SNR xx/yy dB" text in the title bar a popup describes the
    frequency ranges xx and yy refer to.
    
    Admin page > Extensions > FT8 has a new switch causing spots to be recorded to the syslog.
    Same as what the WSPR extension has.
    
    The AGC tab has a "defaults" button that returns all settings to nominal values.
    
    TDoA extension: As you rollover markers, and they highlight yellow, they will now pop in front
    of all other markers and be completely visible. Previously if they were obscured by another
    marker you couldn't see all of their content.
    
    rx.kiwisdr.com will show the product model (e.g. "KiwiSDR 1" or "KiwiSDR 2") instead of just
    "KiwiSDR". But only for Kiwis running v1.666 or later.
    
    All browser cookies have been moved to browser local storage. The difference is that local
    storage is not transmitted with every web request like cookies are.
    Cookies were originally used back in 2016 because local storage didn't exist back then.
    Now it is widely supported by all modern browsers.
    The cookie values were never used for anything on the Kiwi server side. Only for their
    browser storage feature which persists across sessions. So their transmission with each
    web request was very wasteful of network bandwidth (approximately 1 kB per web request).
    
    Bugs fixed:
        Owner/Admin email link no longer closes browser connection.
        Fixed bug in DX label CSV import relating to start/stop schedule times.
        Fixes bug where setting static IP with blank DNS entries disables Ethernet on Debian 11.
        Some minor memory leaks were fixed.

v1.665  March 11, 2024
    Fix EEPROMs with space in part number field.

v1.664  February 19, 2024
    Fix to make photo file uploads on the admin webpage tab work again.

    BBAI-64 Debian 11 backups:
        If you've made any sd card backups using the admin backup tab, ON BBAI-64 ONLY,
        then please do so again using this release.
        There was a bug in the backup script that makes the backup unusable.

    TDoA extension:
        More fixes for waterfall preview mode colormap autoscaling.
        
        Experimental optimizations to "spiderfy" of host and reference markers clusters.
        
        1) When a host or ref cluster is expanded ("spiderfied") the other type of clusters are
            temporarily removed. This eliminates the following annoyance. If the other type
            of cluster is behind the expanded cluster (i.e. visible through the clear spaces of
            the expanded cluster), and the mouse rolls over it, then the current cluster is closed
            and the other type of cluster is expanded. This is almost always not what you want.

        2) The last spiderfied cluster will now contract if the mouse moves far enough away from it.
            Previously the only way for it to contract was to cause another cluster to spiderfy
            (by rolling over it) or clicking in a clear area of the map (annoying).
    
    Use my_kiwi:8073/adc_ov to report accumulated ADC overflow value as JSON e.g. {"adc_ov":1234}
    Use my_kiwi:8073/adc_ov?reset to report value and reset it to zero.
    Effects "adc_ov=" value reported by /status query.

    The 'o' shortcut key now cycles between the control panel tabs: Off, User and Stat instead of
    just Off and Stat.
    
    Fix for timing bug where extensions specified in URL wouldn't always open.
    
v1.662,663  February 9, 2024
    RF attenuator policy (KiwiSDR 2). Admin page control tab menu allows access by:
        1) Everyone, 2) Local connections only, 3) Local connections or password only
        These are the same choices as with the antenna switch. The password is the time limit
        exemption password (admin control tab), specified in the URL by password= or pwd=,
        not the user connection password (admin security tab).

    Frequency undo/redo: When the frequency entry field is highlighted (almost all of the time)
    type shift-return to undo/redo the last frequency change. Useful for old codgers like me who
    keep misclicking or accidentally hitting the trackpad causing unwanted frequency changes.
    
    TDoA extension:
        The sampling station exclusion checkboxes are working again.
        
        Waterfall adjusted so passband center is half way between extension and main control panels
        if using a smaller sized display.
        
        Sampling station waterfall preview mode bug fixes.
        
        Fixed problem since v1.660 with map markers disappearing before you could click on them.

        New URL parameter "refs:" that presets the "Reference station" checkboxes.
        Use "refs:0" to uncheck all. Then "refs:[1-8]" cumulatively to add checkboxes from
        the subcategories. For example "refs:0:2:3" to check milcom and radar.
        Omit ":0" to make ":[1-8]" remove subcategories. I.e. "refs:2:3" selects
        all except milcom and radar.
    
    Added "save" buttons to admin text entry areas:
        webpage tab > additional HTML/Javascript; network tab > local blacklist;
        extensions tab > ALE_2G > admin menu; extensions tab > iframe > HTML/Javascript

v1.660,661  February 5, 2024
    TDoA extension: Added fast waterfall preview of sampling stations. Shift-click on map host icons
        or audio icon in host list. Waterfall (but not the audio) quickly switches to showing
        what sampling station is receiving for 10 seconds (or until you click another),
        then switches back to current Kiwi.

    Admin network tab: Added option to control if blacklist is limited to Kiwi server port or not.
        Useful for special cases e.g. when a local service such as DDNS must talk to a
        hosting provider that is in a blacklisted IP range.
    
    Changes to support KiwiSDR 2.

v1.659  January 25, 2024
    Changes to support KiwiSDR 2.

v1.658  January 20, 2024
    Added "clk_ext_freq=" to /status query for Rob.
    Changes to support KiwiSDR 2.

v1.655,656,657  January 15, 2024
    Fix S-meter ADC overflow indicator.
    Added RF attenuator preset buttons in addition to slider.

v1.654  January 14, 2024
    Debian 11+ backups now working.
    
    TDoA working again after kiwirecorder bug fixed. TDoA extension now only shows sampling stations
    running release v1.653 or later. Because pre and post CIC compensation filter Kiwis cannot be
    mixed during a TDoA run.
    
    Better user interface reaction when you're connected to the admin page using a proxy URL
    and then change the proxy host name or user key. The admin page is automatically reloaded
    using the new host name and/or user key.

v1.651,652,653  January 6, 2024
    Possible fix for TDoA problem.

v1.650  January 4, 2024
    Changed CIC compensation filter gain correction based on better measurements (+3 => +4.5 dB).
    S-meter now shows 1/10 dB digit when value > -100 dBm.
    Sig gen extension attenuation offset is now an independent value saved in browser storage.

v1.647,648,649  January 2, 2024
    Finally fixed the long-standing problem with adjacent channel aliasing into the passband.
    Fixed with Christoph's addition of FPGA CIC compensation filtering which you can read about here:
    hcab14.blogspot.com/2024/01/kiwisdr-gets-cic-compensating-filters.html
    See Kiwi forum for further discussion.
    
    If non-zero RF attenuator value shown in S-meter as a reminder.
    Updated HFDL system table to version 52.

v1.640  December 2, 2023
    Fixed problem with Galileo sats receiving newer subframe types incorrectly showing errors.
    Changes to support KiwiSDR 2.

v1.639  November 26, 2023
    New frequency memory menu user interface:
        Auto or manual save mode.
        Click-hold of memory icon does save in manual save mode.
        Optional save/restore of demod mode.
        Memory recall shortcut keys: ^1 ^2 ... ^9
        Click-hold of VFO A/B icon does VFO A=B.
        Help panel.

v1.637,638  November 22, 2023
    Frequency memory:
        Items are now stored in the memory only on demand instead of automatically while tuning.
        The current frequency is stored in the frequency memory when:
            1) The "store" entry at the top of the memory menu is clicked.
            2) Or the freq memory icon (3 horizontal lines) is click-held for more than one second.
                (it will turn green when the store occurs)
        The "clear all" entry leaves only the current frequency in the memory.
    
    FT8 extension:
        Now decodes the DXpedition and Contest message formats.
        Shows the "i3.n3" message format type under "msg" column.
        Fixed some decoding bugs.

    Waterfall tuning/zooming now resets the inactivity timer. For example if you're recording you
    can reset the inactivity timer without having to change the frequency or mode.
    
    Admin DX tab: Prevent corruption when frequency entered in not in sorted order.

v1.635,636  November 15, 2023
    Support MMSSTV modes: MR73 MR90 MR115 MR140 MR175 MP73 MP115 MP140 MP175
    Changes to support KiwiSDR 2.

v1.634  November 8, 2023
    Fixed timing bug sometimes causing page reload failure when community dx labels selected.
    Update RF attenuator slider when changed by other connections.
        Note that admin-selectable adjustment policies are still not implemented yet.

v1.633  November 5, 2023
    Adjusting waterfall cal on the admin config tab now has immediate effect, like S-meter cal has.
    "set from GPS" buttons added to admin webpage tab and extensions FT8 subtab.
    Changes to support KiwiSDR 2.

v1.631,632  October 27, 2023
    S-meter URL query:
        From a browser or curl use "my_kiwi:8073/s-meter/?(freq_in_kHz)"
        e.g. "my_kiwi:8073/s-meter/?7020" returns the text "/s-meter: 7020.00 kHz -xxx dBm"
        A 60 Hz CW passband is used to sample a presumed carrier on the specified frequency.
    
    DX URL label filtering parameters added:
        dx=(optional database specifier),ident:(ident),notes:(notes),case,grep
        Populates the "DX label filter" panel with values as though you opened the panel
        (e.g. with the "@" shortcut key). Example: my_kiwi:8073/f=15Mz0&dx=comm,id:HFDL
        Where "comm" selects the community label database. "case" means the ident and notes values
        are case sensitive. "grep" means the values are pattern-selecting regular expressions.
    
        New shortcut alt-@ to quickly clear all DX label filtering values without opening the panel.
        
        See the help button on the DX labels panel ("\" key) for more details.
    
    Changes to support KiwiSDR 2.
        Update Github README.md file with KiwiSDR 2 info.
        Show KiwiSDR 2 PCB as default photo when user first connects.

v1.629,630  October 15, 2023
    Allow clickable links in the DX label ident field. Example:
    BEACON C&P #5 FSK <a href="https://www.hfunderground.com/wiki/Common_and_Precious_5"
        target="_blank">hfunderground.com</a>
    Results in the DX label: "BEACON C&P #5 FSK hfunderground.com" where the "hfunderground.com"
    portion is an underlined clickable link. 'target="_blank"' makes the link open in a new tab.
    
    The DX community database has two of these links at 4095 kHz for the Berlin C&P #5 beacon.
    The hfunderground.com link goes to the beacon's wiki page. One label starts the CW decoder and
    the other label starts the FSK decoder, for the two modes sent by this beacon.
    
    Describe URL parameters in CW extension help.
    
    Admin backup tab: Disabled on Debian 11 again because it's still not working quite right.

    Admin network tab:
        Debian 11: Static/DHCP setting change now works. Fix needed due to the Beagle guys migrating
        from connman to systemd-networkd.
    
    TDoA extension:
        Top bar visibilities now correctly restored on extension close.

    Changes to support KiwiSDR 2:
        GPS clock startup hack.
        Disable sig gen self-test menu item if ext clk enabled (both can't be used at the same time).

v1.627,628  October 5, 2023
    Rework of admin backup tab:
        Now works for Debian 11 and later. Debian 11 is currently used by the BBAI-64.
        Progress bar now accurately shows sd card copy progress.
        Should now correctly abort backup if admin page is reloaded while backup running.

    Changes to support KiwiSDR 2.
    
    Fixed bug where audio wouldn't un-mute after underlying masked area removed (thanks Rob).

    The SNR-measure task ARRIVED/LEAVING messages are no longer logged.

v1.626  September 17, 2023
    Error message and logging improvements to admin clone operation.
    
    DX label uploads: improved realtime response.
    
    In 14-channel mode (AI-64/AI/RPi only) GPS channels reduced from 12 to 10 to recover
    needed FPGA space.
    
    Updated Galileo and QZSS sat constellation tables.

v1.625  September 9, 2023
    Must continue to support old EEPROM version value for KiwiSDR 1.

v1.624  September 6, 2023
    Fixed bug in DX label CSV file importing.

v1.623  September 4, 2023
    Added "RF" tab to user control panel. KiwiSDR 2 RF attenuator control is here.
        In the future other functions will move here like the antenna switch.

    Admin control tab: "daily restart" now a menu allowing restart or reboot (thanks Glenn, N6GN).

    Other changes to support KiwiSDR 2.

v1.622  August 23, 2023
    Instead of the full test message decode, ALE_2G extension will only show "[periodic self test]"
    in the decode panel during the periodic self test which occurs every 4 hours.
    
    Added fix for VPNs (e.g. Cloudflare WARP) that fragment the IP source address of related web sockets.
    
    Added URL parameters and help panel to signal generator extension.
    
    Changes to support KiwiSDR 2.

v1.621  July 21, 2023
    DRM extension now works in Kiwi 3-channel, 20.25 kHz mode. This allows reception of
    18 and 20 kHz wide DRM channels, e.g. India mediumwave (AM BCB).

    Show platform (BBG/B, BBAI, BBAI-64, RPi) in user stats tab and admin status tab instead of
        the previous fixed text of "BB" and "Beagle".

v1.620  July 17, 2023
    New URL parameter "1hz" increasing frequency resolution to 1 Hz if Kiwi configured for 10 Hz.
        Example: kiwi_name:8073/?1hz  kiwi_name:8073/?...&1hz
    
    Camping-mode panel now shows a message when:
        The channel user has tuned to a masked frequency and the camper does not have masked
            listening privileges i.e. "pwd=(time-limit-password)" not given.
        The channel user disconnects.

v1.617,618,619  July 13, 2023
    Loran-C extension: add entry for US west coast eLoran test GRI.
    Misc fixes and improvements.

v1.615,616  July 8, 2023
    Fixed problem with DX label edits causing audio glitching.
    Fixed problem causing some Kiwis to not be seen on rx.kiwisdr.com list or
        respond to admin network tab "check port open" button.

v1.612,613,614  July 5, 2023
    Admin console improvements:
        Can now paste from system clipboard into console (e.g. shell or text editor).
        Mac: Use the usual command-v key.
        Windows: Use the usual control-v, but type it twice in quick succession. This is because
            control-v is used by the "nano" text editor for "page down". So there needs to be a
            way for a control-v to get through that is not interpreted as a system paste. And this
            is accomplished by typing control-v once, instead of twice, within a small time window.
        The bottom line of the admin console tab displays a summary of these changes.

        Many fixes to the ANSI command interpreter. This makes full screen programs like htop
        (alias 'ht') and text editors work much better.
    
    ALE-2G extension: Test function run every 4 hours as a workaround to prevent scanning lockup.

v1.611  July 1, 2023
    Reduced occurrences of unnecessary config file updates.

    Hopefully eliminated problems with corrupted configuration files by double checking json format
    integrity immediately before file is written.
    
    Added frequency offset to FT8 spots sent to pskreporter.info  For example a Kiwi setup with a
    6m downconverter will now send spots with the correct frequency.
    
    For BBAI added Makefile dependency rule to automatically do "make install_kiwi_device_tree"
    when required (same as BBAI-64 does now).

v1.610  Jun 28, 2023
    Possible fix for observed memory corruption bug (thanks Paul, VK3KHZ).

v1.609  Jun 26, 2023
    DX label system:
        The stored dx label database (only if never modified by admin) has been updated to a snapshot
            of the current community database.
        Better error handling when there is corruption of the various dx label *.json files.
            Error messages will appear in the admin DX tab and also the user DX labels panel.
        Selecting a database menu entry on the DX labels panel now keeps the panel open.
    
    Waterfall tuning: Type "#frequency" into the frequency entry box on the main control panel
    to directly tune the waterfall center frequency (independently of the audio channel frequency).
    For example if you're tuned to 7020 kHz listening to CW you could quickly tune the waterfall
    to the 30m FT8 frequency by typing "#10136"  Type "#" alone to return the waterfall to the
    current audio channel frequency. The "k" and "M" suffixes apply, e.g. "#10M" for 10 MHz.
    Previously the waterfall could only be tuned by mouse/touch gestures, shortcut keys and the
    page up/down buttons.
    
    Frequency entry field help: If the cursor is positioned over the frequency entry field,
    and 'h' or '?' is typed, a help panel is shown with information about the optional passband
    and waterfall tuning parameters. Typing 'h' or '?' with the cursor anywhere else shows the
    standard help panel. Typing 'H' when no extension is open also opens shows this help.

v1.608  Jun 19, 2023
    Antenna switch extension improvements:
    Must install the latest extension from: github.com/jks-prv/KiwiSDR-antenna-switch-extension
        Beagle GPIO backend now also works with BBAI and BBAI-64.
        Beagle GPIO backend supports the full 10 channels, not just the default 8.
        Selecting antenna via URL parameter when in password mode now works.

v1.605,606,607  Jun 15, 2023
    Added variable sample time to TDoA extension (15, 30, 45, 60 seconds).
    Right-click menu: new option "show cursor frequency". State is saved in a browser cookie.
    Show selected label database on frequency scale.
    Shift-click on "Spec RF/AF" button toggles in reverse (same effect as alt-s key).
    New "dx" URL parameter "open" that shows DX labels panel.
        i.e. "dx=2" vs "dx=2,open". See DX labels panel help.
    
    DX community label database changes:
        Adopted EiBi label type classification / color scheme.
        Standardized on three letter country codes (except UK), two letter USA state codes.
        DX labels panel shows type category names, colors and counts. Same as is done for EiBi.

    Fixes:
        Spec button toggle direction now correct.
        Increased size of waterfall cursor frequency text.
    
v1.603,604  Jun 10, 2023
    DX label popups no longer have modifier key explanations. Refer to DX label help button instead.

    Extension help keyboard shortcut: When an extension is open (or the DX label panel) typing 'H'
    will open the extension's help panel. The global help panel is still opened with 'h' or '?'
    
    Clarified use of alt and control keys in global help panel and DX label help panel.

    Bug fixes:
        DX label panel "add" button now working.
        Various fixes to labels with non-zero signal bandwidths.
        Antenna disconnect detector now works properly for disconnect/reconnect transitions.
        When displaying a large number of EiBi labels the audio should no longer glitch.
        For BBAi-64 10 Mbps Ethernet mode is disabled due to the Ethernet interface hanging.
        Fixed problem where 'x' shortcut key caused all subsequent shortcuts to stop functioning.
        Fixed dist.admin.json recovery file.
        Optimized size of DRM extension control panel.

v1.602  Jun 3, 2023
    Only one admin connection at a time allowed:
        To eliminate problems with corrupted configuration files multiple simultaneous admin
        connections are no longer allowed. If you attempt to do so, and supply the admin password
        if required, you will be given the opportunity to "kick" the other admin connection
        (i.e. close it so that the current connection may now connect).
    
        This "kick" feature is designed to solve the following problem: You have a Kiwi located at a
        remote location, say, a two hours drive away. You unintentionally leave a computer at that
        location connected as admin to the Kiwi. When you got home you would be unable to connect as
        admin to the Kiwi without the "kick" feature (unless you could screen-share with the remote
        computer and close its browser admin connection directly).

    Why is my Kiwi restarting occasionally?
        The admin status tab now shows a list of all possible reasons a nightly restart might occur.
        And also describes where all the option settings are located to disable the restart cause.
    
    DX label system -- many improvements and changes:
        Default dx.json database update:
            As you may know the default stored label database (dx.json file) dates from 2016.
            It was really just everything we heard when the Kiwi first started working.
            The hope was that it would serve as an example and Kiwi admins would customize it.
            Well of course that didn't happen in many case. And lots of public Kiwis are now stuck
            with an outdated and inappropriate set of labels.
        
            So this release addresses that problem. The dx.json file is checked. And if it has never
            been modified then a new, updated dx.json replaces it. We stress that if any change
            whatsoever has been made to the dx.json file then this replacement will not occur
            (i.e. no changes made by the owner/admin will be lost). The only exception is that
            that label-related information contained in kiwi.json will be moved to the new file
            dx_config.json as described below. Although the information itself will not be changed.
        
        Community database:
            It occurred to us that this idea could be extended as follows. A third database could be
            added with this updated dx.json file as the starting point. It would be stored on
            kiwisdr.com and periodically downloaded using the same mechanism as exist for updating
            the IP blacklist. Changes to this database, called the "community" database, would be
            made and discussed on the forum. We would consolidate the changes and maintain the file
            as we do the IP blacklist.
        
            So the community database appears as a third menu entry in the label edit panel of a
            user connection. The shortcut keys also cycle through the database etc. And an admin can
            set the default database that a new connection to a Kiwi will use via a menu entry at
            the top of the admin DX tab. There is also a switch that determines if nightly
            auto checking/downloading will occur. And a "Download now" button for manual control.
        
            The current database is available for viewing:
                Links on the kiwisdr.com webpage
                kiwisdr.com/dx/dx_community.json
                kiwisdr.com/dx/dx_community_config.json
            
            Note that, just as with the ip blacklist, disabling auto downloading will prevent your
            Kiwi from restarting during the nightly update window (if a new community database is
            available).
                
        Migrating label information out of kiwi.json:
            In addition to the label information stored in dx.json additional information is stored
            as part of the general kiwi.json config file. However this causes a problem when the
            admin config "clone" function is used in the mode that only copies the label information
            (and not the entire configuration). The label-related information cannot be easily
            isolated from the rest of kiwi.json  To solve this problem this release extracts the
            label information out of kiwi.json and places it in a new file, dx_config.json, that
            compliments dx.json  These two files are then copied during a label-only clone operation.
            A full admin clone also moves dx_config.json along with all the other config files.

            CAUTION: Don't clone across the v1.{601,602} boundary. That is, Kiwis running v1.602
            must not clone from Kiwis running v1.601 (or less). And vice versa. Let all your Kiwis
            update to v1.602 (or greater) then resume cloning between them.
        
        User interface changes:
            Labels specifying an extension:
                A black bar will now appear on the right side of the label. This gives user interface
                consistency with mobile devices where there is no equivalent of the mouse-over
                color change which occurs with the desktop interface.
        
            Mobile device labels that specify an extension no longer always open the extension
            when the label is touched. You must now touch-hold the label for longer than half a second.
        
            The last database in use is saved in a browser cookie and restored when reconnecting.
        
            Shortcut keys:
                For EiBi you now use alt/ctrl-click (or shift-click) to not open the extension (if any).
                This is now consistent with how the other databases work.
                For desktop, mousing over the label shows all the valid key combinations in the popup.

                The first time you click shift-\ (i.e. '|') the label panel appears as usual,
                but for the current database rather than the following one.
        
                Alt/ctrl '\' toggles the "filter by time/day-of-week" checkbox for the current database.
        
            The right-click menu has entries to open all but the current label database
            (now that we have more than two databases).
        
            When changes are made in the label edit panel (from a user connection) the "modify" or
            "add" buttons now highlight to remind you they need to be clicked to commit the changes.
        
        EiBi database improvements:
            Updated to the A32 version.
            Service classification improvements (e.g. some entries now correctly classified as Aero).
            The service counts on the control panel are no longer inflated by multiple schedule entries.
                i.e. there are really only about 6000 EiBi entries, not 17000 as reported previously.
            Time station passbands and extension settings optimized.
            Fixed: Not all schedule entries were showing in the label popup for zoom levels 0-5.
        
        Signal bandwidth:
            A new label parameter "signal bandwidth" was added. When a label is clicked that has
            this parameter specified a blue line appears below the label. The width of this line
            represents the bandwidth of the signal. It is intended to be used for signals that are
            much wider than the passband of the receiver (e.g. OTHR, CODAR, HFT, etc). The field
            "sig bw" (kHz) now appears in the user label edit panel and admin DX tab.
            The JSON/CSV export/import function handles the new field and will continue to accept
            older files that don't contain the field. Further work may be needed to refine this idea
            (suggested by Martin).
        
        Admin DX tab, "Band bars" panel:
            The freq/mode field on the right now allows an optional zoom to be specified.
            Same format as "f=" URL parameter: freq[mode][zoom] e.g. 5154cwnz14
            This was inspired by the Russian markers (single letter beacons), e.g. 5154 kHz,
            where multiple labels are spaced 100 Hz apart and you really need to zoom in to see them.
        
        Extension field frequency:
            Many extensions interpret the first parameter of the label extension field (and also of
            the URL parameters) as a frequency to match in the extension's preset menus.
            So for example a label for frequency 4210 kHz (MSI safety, SITOR-B) could have an
            extension field of "fsk,4210". But entering the same freq, 4210, in the extension field
            is redundant and prone to error. So now an entry of "*" (e.g. "fsk,*") will simply pass
            the label's frequency through to the extension. You can still specify a numeric frequency
            for those few cases where the two frequencies are actually different.

    (end DX label system improvements)
        
    Antenna disconnect detector:
        The SNR measurement process on the Kiwi now attempts to detect if the antenna is disconnected.
        The consequences of this are:
            1) A new field "ant_connected=1|0" will appear in a /status query (e.g. my_kiwi:8073/status)
            2) rx.kiwisdr.com now shows the two SNR values (all:HF) in the listing for all Kiwis.
                And a message plus red background will appear for any Kiwi with a disconnection.
        There are criteria for deciding if there is a disconnect to hopefully prevent false-positives.
        They are:
            1) Only Kiwis operating at HF are considered (i.e. the admin config tab "freq scale offset"
                field is zero. This is because other frequency ranges (especially V/UHF) can have
                much more frequent periods of no signals compared to HF.
            2) The "all" frequency SNR value (first one of the two displayed) is less than 4 dB.
            3) There are no more than two signal peaks stronger than -100 dBm at HF (1.8 - 30/32 MHz).
                This is needed because there were a number of public Kiwis observed that have greatly
                attenuated reception (for whatever reason). There are signals there, but they are
                very weak. The attenuation causes the SNR < 4 dB criteria above to be met.
    
    FSK extension parameter aliases:
        There are many parameters required to configure the fsk extension. Some aliases have now
        been added to make things easier. Suppose you have a DX label for a SITOR-B signal with an
        extension field of "fsk,*,s:170,b:100,4/7,i:0,CCIR476" Now you can simply say
        "fsk,*,sitor-b" instead.
        The available aliases are:
            sitor-b     s:170,b:100,4/7,i:0,CCIR476
            wx          s:450,b:50,5N1.5,i:1,ITA2
            dsc         s:170,b:100,7/3,i:1,DSC
            selcall     s:170,b:100,7/3,i:0,Selcall
            ham         s:170,b:45.45,5N1.5,i:0,ITA2
        More can be added as needed. Use the extension help button to see the full/current list.

    Spectrum peak hold buttons ('P1' & 'P2'):
        If you hold shift while clicking the buttons toggle in reverse.
        That is off->on->hold->off becomes off->hold->on->off
        This means for example fewer clicks are required to go back-and-forth between on and hold.
    
    Spectrum shortcut:
        Typing alt/ctrl-s will toggle the spectrum selection in reverse:
        That is off->RF->AF->off becomes off->AF->RF->off (shift-s already used for auto-scale)
    
    Misc:
        NBFM squelch fixed. Squelch should now close at a more reasonable slider setting.
        Admin console column width now scales with window width.
        Fixed problem with SPI device name for systems using latest BBAI-64 update.

v1.601  Apr 25, 2023
    Admin page:
        Debian version now shown on status tab.
        Backup tab shows error message if Debian 11 (or higher) because backups not supported yet.
            Currently this only effects BBAI-64. BBAI running Debian 9 and BBG/B Debian 10 work.
    
    GPS: Fixed bug with Galileo solution accuracy introduced as a side-effect of Verilog
    code cleanup (thanks Tom and Glenn).

v1.600  Apr 23, 2023
    FT8/WSPR autorun:
        For waterfall-limited, split configurations (e.g. rx8_wf2) allow waterfall channels to be
        used initially (after rx3-rx7 have been filled) except for the case of preemption restart.
        This restores the prior behavior allowing e.g. 7 of 8 channels to be initialized with
        autorun processes.
        
        Stop autorun processes during an sd card backup and resume afterwards.

v1.599  Apr 21, 2023
    Autorun: Don't use waterfall channels on waterfall-limited, split configurations (e.g. rx8_wf2).

v1.598  Apr 19, 2023
    /adc API: When a level of zero is specified (e.g. my_kiwi:8073/adc?level=0) the ADC overload
    signal will be counted instead of the current "ADC value over level threshold" scheme.
    This will give a precise count of ADC overload events compared to the "adc_ov=N" entry in
    the /status API which is an averaged and quantized indicator.
    
    FT8/WSPR admin page: Added "set all to regular use" button as a fast way to clear autorun menus.

    Don't display unwanted top bar when extensions open.

v1.597  Apr 17, 2023
    Autorun/preemption bug fix for TDoA extension.

v1.596  Apr 16, 2023
    Autorun/preemption bug fixes.

v1.595  Apr 14, 2023
    Autorun/preemption bug fixes.

v1.594  Apr 12, 2023
    ADC level measurement: AJAX/JSON interface to help determine how much "headroom" is available in
    the ADC. That is, how often the upper bits of the 14-bit ADC are getting set by strong signals.
    Interface similar to how /snr works, i.e. my_kiwi:8073/adc?level=0x1800
    Done this way so it doesn't require a channel connection, which would otherwise be very intrusive
    given how often measurements will probably have to be made to properly characterize the headroom.
    Note that this is fundamentally different from the current overload indicator on the S-meter
    which is an averaged measurement of the full-scale overflow signal produced by the ADC itself.
    Complete discussion on the forum.
    
    The SNR measurement process will now run if a preemptable autorun channel is available (thanks Martin).

    Admin page, control tab. New checkbox:
    "Non-Kiwi connections (kiwirecorder, TDoA) can preempt autorun processes"
    
    When an autorun process gets kicked the log will say e.g. "(PREEMPTED after 0:12:34)" instead of
    "(LEAVING after 0:12:34)".

v1.593  Apr 11, 2023
    Fixed problem where new user connections were incorrectly being redirected even though
    preemptable autorun processes exist.

    Fixed problem where camping a channel sometimes resulted in very low volume because the wrong
    initial compression state was being used.

v1.592  Apr 10, 2023
    Reverted change causing NBFM distortion (thanks Glenn).

    FT8/WSPR autorun preemption: A new menu on the autorun configuration section allows you to
    specify if an autorun process is preemptable. I.e. a new incoming user connection will
    kick the autorun process off the channel and take its place. Every 10 seconds autorun processes
    will attempt to fill empty channels. Kiwirecorder connections should not interrupt preemptable
    autoruns. Only Kiwi user connections. (thanks Martin)

    WSPR extension:
        Control panel height now set to 90% the height of the waterfall (thanks Eric).
        
        Spot upload debugging: On the admin > extensions > WSPR page, when "Log spot debug info?" is
        "Yes" then an additional line in the log will show the actual upload response from wsprnet.org
            e.g.    WSPR UPLOAD: wsprnet.org said: "1 out of 1 spot(s) added"
        Upload debugging only works for WSPR autorun currently.
    
    S-meter extension: Defaults for all control panel values can be set on the
        Admin > Extensions > S-meter page (thanks Eric).
    
    kiwiclient/kiwirecorder: Added support for URL redirection. Requires most recent version of
    kiwirecorder and kiwi server v1.592 or later to be used (thanks loststation).
    
    Kick reason: The admin control tab has a new field "Reason if kicked" that will be displayed in
    a panel when a user connection is kicked. Previously a kicked connection would just stop with
    no explanation (thanks Rob who suggested this some time ago I believe).
    
    Internal connections (e.g. autorun) behavior w.r.t. disabled/kicked connections:
    An internal connection will ignore the disabling of user connections and ignore the
    global kick button (both on admin control tab). However individual internal connections can
    still be kicked via the button on the admin status page.

v1.591  Apr 3, 2023
    FT8: Added autorun function. Works the same as WSPR autorun. See Admin > Extensions > FT8 page.
    FT8/4 autorun channels display "NNN decoded", much like WSPR, where NNN is a count of pending
    spots to be uploaded to pskreporter.info Pending, because uploads to pskreporter.info only
    occur once every 5 minutes.

v1.589,590  Apr 1, 2023
    Workaround added for the IQ extension residual phase rotation problem. Details on the forum:
    forum.kiwisdr.com/index.php?p=/discussion/2852/unexpected-iq-phase-shift-in-gpsdo-kiwi/p1
    
    Debian 8 is now deprecated. Existing Kiwis using Debian 8 and a recent Kiwi software version
    will continue to receive auto-updates and don't really need to do anything.
    But re-flashing from the factory v1.2 image (on the supplied sd card) or from the old v1.390
    img.xz file no longer works as the Debian 8 repos from debian.org are now broken.
    However, if you're running Debian 8 you can choose to upgrade to Debian 10.
    Instructions are on the forum.

    Spec AF:
        Indented the maximum bandwidth edges and mark with red lines (thanks Paul).
        Moved the de-emphasis filter before the FFT-based passband filter so the effect of
        de-emphasis will now appear in the Spec AF display.

    Spectrum peak hold:
        In peak hold active mode a mousedown on P1 P2 for more than one second will clear the trace.
        Added border to peak buttons P1 P1 with colors matching the yellow/magenta trace color.
            Text colors similar to before: white=OFF green=ACTIVE orange=HOLD (was magenta)
        Fixed problem where activating peak hold didn't always work in until the second try.
    
    Admin console: Optimized ANSI color palette for increased contrast. For example a
        "nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config" is readable now (thanks Rob). Fixed other ANSI-related bugs.

v1.587,588  Mar 13, 2023
    FT8 extension:
        Limit log output to 1024 lines (roughly 10 minutes of decodes). Prevents browser from
        eventually going into meltdown.
    Reverted SNR measurement change per request.

v1.585,586  Mar 12, 2023
    The spectrum ("Spec") button on the main control panel now toggles between the existing
    waterfall spectrum (renamed "Spec RF") and a new audio channel spectrum ("Spec AF").
    Spec AF is identical to the spectrum function on the FFT extension (which has been removed).
    This change allows the AF spectrum to be observed when other extensions (that don't use the
    top display) are running. The sig gen in particular.

    FT8 extension:
        Set default SNR correction value to -22 dB.
        Include decoder-computed SNR in spots uploaded to pskreporter.info
        Added background color stripes to log messages for easier reading (thanks Martin).

    Fixed bug causing incorrect reseting of admin page WSPR grid field while typing.
    SNR reporting task takes twice as many measurements spread out over one minute.

v1.584  Mar 6, 2023
    FT8 extension:
        First URL parameter selects an entry in the freq menu, E.g. "my_kiwi:8073/?ext=ft8,10136"
        
        Added clickable call/grid links to older, previously reported, spots.
        
        Added "age" column. After a call/grid spot is uploaded to pskreporter.info the callsign is
        cached and prevented from uploading again for 60 minutes. The age column shows this
        cache timer. The age cache is cleared when FT8/FT4 mode is changed or the
        frequency changed by more than 1 kHz, e.g. a band change or a change to a different
        signal cluster (e.g. 10136 regular versus 10140 used for a particular DX operation).
        
        Added link to pskreporter.info map page with the reporter callsign preset and defaults
        of: all bands, signals, rcvd by, callsign, FT8, 24 hrs.
        
        Added help button content.

v1.583  Mar 4, 2023
    FT8 extension: Make spot callsign and grid clickable links like WSPR extension.
    Fixed "Antenna switch extension is not configured" problem.

v1.581  Mar 3, 2023
    FT8 extension initial release. See Kiwi forum for details.

v1.579  Mar 2, 2023
    Revert spectrum peak hold colors.
    Extension development/testing.

v1.578  Feb 12, 2023
    Fixed bug setting dx label modes.
    Improved high end response of NBFM de-emphasis filters.
    Squelch value updated continuously while slider moved, not just on mouse-up.
    New colors for spectrum peak hold traces and "slow dev" plot based on forum discussions.

v1.577  Feb 6, 2023
    Audio response de-emphasis for AM/SSB and NBFM:
        On the main control panel, audio tab, the "de-emp" menu to the right of the volume control
        has been greatly improved. For AM/SSB modes the traditional 75 uS (N.Am) and 50 uS (EU)
        filter profiles are available. For NBFM a 20 dB / decade (= 6 dB / octave) is available,
        with or without ("+LF") attenuation below 400 Hz (e.g. to suppress PL tone etc).
        The de-emp menu settings are stored and persistent across page reloads.
        
        Comments welcome. These filters are now FIR-based and designed with Octave from a
        frequency response profile. So they are easy to adjust.
    
    A second spectrum peak hold is available. The "Pk" button on the WF tab has been replaced by
    "P1" and "P2". Each click on Pk cycled between off/clear(wht) and hold(grn).
    But P1 and P2 cycle between three states: off(wht) - on(grn) - hold(red).
    This is so one can be in hold mode while the other is on. P1 is the yellow trace and P2 cyan.
    
    The momentary zero icon of the left of the squelch slider has been changed to a toggle.
    
    The default FAX passband has been lowered from 2200 Hz to 1200 Hz. It was observed that for weak
    signals this slightly reduced the background noise in the image without lowering the overall
    contrast, indicating that the extra passband width was just increasing the noise floor.
    Comments welcome. You can type "/2200" or "/2k" in the frequency box to re-widen the passband.

v1.576  Feb 2, 2023
    FM demodulator:
        Added NNFM mode which has a 6 kHz passband useful for FM signals with +/- 2.5 kHz deviation.
        Fixed "rough", "crackling" sound of demod. Needed a post-demod clipper.

    WSPR extension:
        Added test button. Test result spots are NOT uploaded to wsprnet.org
        Added help panel.
    
    Restore mode and passband on extension exit from: FAX, FFT, HFDL, IQ, SSTV and WSPR
    
    By request, right-click menu shows both of these entries all the time:
        "open DX label edit panel" and "edit last selected DX label"
        Previously they appeared in a single menu slot under different conditions
        which wasn't optimal for all use cases (Thanks W4ILM).

    FAX frequency menu updates.

v1.574  Jan 9, 2023
    DRM extension: preliminary slideshow support for testing.
    IP blacklist: added 192.248.176.0/20 (constant/vultr/choopa) courtesy F4FPR. Thanks!

v1.573  Jan 1, 2023
    DRM extension: preliminary Journaline support for testing.

v1.572  Dec 29, 2022
    EiBi database fixes:
        The label stepping function (alt-pan buttons or shift-alt/ctrl LR-arrow keys) with EiBi labels
        was completely broken. The EiBi category selection and "filter by time/day-of-week" in the
        "DX label edit" panel was not considered properly. In addition, entries in the
        "DX label filter" panel are now properly considered.
        
        Fix category misclassification of Shannon Aeradio and a few broadcast stations (e.g. WBCQ) in
            the 5130 - 5150 kHz range.

v1.571  Dec 27, 2022
    Admin page DX tab: CAUTION: If you have a "normal" Kiwi with HF DX labels only you don't need to
    perform the conversion process described below. You don't need to do anything.
    
    From this release forward new DX labels stored in the dx.json file will use
    their true frequency instead of their normalized baseband freq (0 to 30/32 MHz). This will allow
    proper label display when using a variable frequency downconverter (such as the freq extender
    developed by Glenn, N6GN, www.sonic.net/~n6gn/BCReferenceBlock.png)
    
    So for example if dx.json contains a combination of HF labels and airband labels (108-137 MHz)
    then the airband labels won't be used until the Kiwi frequency offset is configured for
    108 MHz (via either the admin interface or the "foff=108000" user page URL parameter).
    
    However, this means there needs to be a conversion process for pre-v1.571 Kiwis with non-HF
    labels in dx.json (e.g. those setup for airband or vhf/uhf ham bands). The label frequencies
    must be adjusted from baseband to their true frequencies. This could be done (rather painfully)
    one label at a time via the admin DX tab.

    But in v1.571 a bulk mechanism for adding the freq offset to ALL the labels has been added.
    It will appear at the top of the admin DX tab, but only if a non-zero frequency offset if set
    (i.e. Kiwi is setup (presumably) for non-HF operation). When the "Add offset" button is pressed
    a one-time addition of the current frequency offset is made to ALL labels in dx.json
    The mechanism will then disappear and not be shown again since this is a one-time operation.
    There is also a button saying: "Skip this and don't ask again". A backup copy of dx.json is
    made for safety. Ask on the Kiwi forum if you get into trouble.
    
    If you never removed the HF labels before beginning non-HF operation then DON'T perform the
    above conversion. You don't want the HF labels to be shifted into your non-HF band.
    Instead, with v1.571 or later, just begin adding labels with non-HF frequencies and they will
    be stored with their true frequencies distinguishing them from the existing HF labels.
    
    This change prevents the EiBi database labels from appearing when a frequency offset
    is in effect. The change also makes the labels appear properly when only a part of the
    HF band is visible (e.g. a frequency offset of 25 MHz is used with a converter that captures
    the 10, 8 and 6m ham bands together).
    ----
    
    User page DX edit panel and admin page DX tab: Can use 'k' and 'M' suffixes in frequency entry
    boxes e.g. "116M" instead of  "116000" (kHz). Note: this has always been true for the
    passband field where you could specify e.g. "2k" instead of "2000" (Hz).
    
    When attempting a privileged operation from a user connection (DX label edit, ADC clock adjust
    etc.) an error is displayed if an admin connection is also open. After closing the admin
    connection you had to completely repeat the privileged operation. Now it is automatically
    completed with no further action required.
    
    Admin page security tab: new option "Automatically reload admin page if server stops responding?
    Defaults to "Yes", the current behavior. If set to "No" the page won't reload, but instead
    a warning message will appear when disconnection is detected.
    
    DRM extension: Hovering the cursor over the schedule entries now also shows the begin/end times.

v1.570  Dec 19, 2022
    Pass configured frequency offset in sound/waterfall API. For benefit of kiwirecorder.
    
    wfm=min,max URL parameter now respected when in audio FFT display mode.
    URL parameter wfa (also wfa=1) to select auto aperture mode, wfa=0 for manual mode.
    
    Software update Internet connectivity check: If ping of 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare DNS) fails try
        8.8.8.8 (Google DNS). Workaround for an ISP that intercepts 1.1.1.1 making it un-pingable.

v1.568,569  Nov 14, 2022
    Update to EiBi B22 database.
    
    NAVTEX/DSC/Selcall extension:
        Add message that says map display is for Selcall beacons only (e.g. not DSC).

v1.567  Nov 4, 2022
    Work around certificate trouble with timezonedb.com
    Makefile: Install connman package.

v1.566  Oct 17, 2022
    Admin backup tab: Fixed bug preventing output from appearing in text panel.

v1.565  Oct 13, 2022
    HFDL:
        Restore DX database settings on extension close.
        Most recently updated aircraft marker shown in yellow.
    
    Admin console:
        Fix long line wrapping in non-ANSI mode.

v1.564  Oct 10, 2022
    Fixed bug in new console code that effects display of links in DSC output text.

v1.563  Oct 6, 2022
    Admin console tab:
        Supports "character-oriented" input mode compared to the previous line-oriented mode
        where all input was typed into a field outside of the output display window. Now resembles
        a more traditional terminal program. Not supported on mobile devices.
        
        As a result, Xterm/VT100 style ANSI command sequences are accepted. This allows programs
        that perform 2D X/Y screen addressing to work such as the "nano" text editor and "htop" and
        "top -c" process display utilities.
        
        Also, shell line editing via control keys and keypad arrows should work (e.g. ctrl-P or
        up arrow for previous entry from command history, ctrl-A for beginning of line etc).

    Neglected to mention earlier: Galileo sat table updated to add E10. Thanks Benjamin F4FPR/K5AW.

    TDoA extension:
        Changed server polling mechanism to (hopefully) fix a problem with certain 4G mobile
        connections dropping the TDoA connection prematurely.
    
        Removed "rerun" button because it produces incorrect heat map results. And in fact I don't
        believe it's possible to work in any event. If you change the map lat/lon you need new
        samples by definition of the algorithm (I think).

    Moved "Proxy server hostname" field from admin network tab to connect tab
    ("reverse proxy configuration" section) where it really belongs.
    
    Removed "SAM options" menu from audio tab since it seems default "DC block + fade" option
    is the correct setting to use.
    
v1.562  Sep 16, 2022
    Fixed bug causing Kiwi 8 and 14-channel (BBAI et al) modes to fail loading page displaying
    audio FFT instead of the full waterfall. For example channels 3-8 in 8-channel mode.

v1.560,561  Sep 13, 2022
    New audio "pre-record time" menu (located to the left of the squelch tail length menu).
    Allows audio samples stored from before the "record" button is pressed, or before the
    squelch opens, to be included in file recordings.
    
        Handy for when you hear something you want to record but it takes you a few seconds to hit
        the record key ('r') or click the record button. Or you find critical content missing from
        the recorded file because the squelch opens too slowly (e.g. preamble to a data burst).
    
    The (non-NBFM) squelch has this feature/problem that it only responds to relative changes in
    signal strength. For example, if it is set to 10 dB then the squelch will only open when there
    is a 10 dB *increase* in signal strength. This means if you had a non-zero squelch value set
    while tuned to a strong signal, and then reload the page, the squelch remains open (no audio).
    This happens because there has never been a 10 dB increase in signal strength from the
    squelch's perspective.

        To fix this you must tune to a quiet part of the band, set the squelch to zero to establish
        the noise floor, then set it back to the desired value (10 dB in our example).
        To make this operation easier a new button just before the squelch slider will momentarily
        zero the squelch value while pressed. Wait a few seconds with the button pressed for the
        squelch to establish a new noise floor.
        
        In case you're wondering, the NBFM squelch doesn't have this problem because it constantly
        measures the threshold noise power above the voice frequencies in the FM channel. So it
        is able to make a continuous relative measurement. This is difficult in the non-NBFM
        environment. Somewhat related to our difficulties in automating SNR measurement.

    "SAM options" menu now works for the other SAM modes (SAL, SAU, SAS, QAM).
    
    S-meter extension now has its own menu for setting the timestamps to UTC or local time.
    Previously the value from the waterfall extension UTC/local menu was used.
    
    Waterfall and S-meter timestamps now appended with "UTC" or "L".

    Fixed a somewhat strange problem with proxied Kiwis: If you had a low value in the menu on the
    admin control tab "Number of simultaneous channels available for connection by non-Kiwi apps"
    (like "none" or "1") then some non-local, legitimate browser connections would sometimes get
    flagged as a "non-Kiwi app" and denied a connection. The details are hard to explain.
    
        Anyway, it is fixed. So if you had to increase the menu value as a workaround you should be
        able to decrease it again. A lower value is helpful if you have lots of bots connecting that
        you're trying to limit (the bots are classified as non-Kiwi connections). You usually want
        at least one non-Kiwi connection to handle legitimate TDoA or kiwirecorder use.
    
        As usual, connections from the local network are exempt from all this. So for example
        wsprdaemon running on an RPi on the local network won't be subject to this limit.    

v1.559  Sep 7, 2022
    Added DC block to the SAM/QAM modes. There is a temporary menu on the main control panel,
        audio tab, to allow A/B testing of the DC block against the existing fade leveler that was
        already part of the SAM code. Thanks to Daz for pointing out this problem.

v1.558  Sep 4, 2022
    Passband adjustment improvements:
        Adjust left/right passband edges individually
            The arrow up/down keys now adjust the passband. With the shift key added the right
            passband alone is adjusted (passband high in USB). With alt/ctrl passband low is adjusted.
            With no modifier keys pressed both passband edges are adjusted (like the "p" and "P" keys).
            
            Also for a shift or alt/ctrl during a mouse wheel while positioned in the frequency scale.
            
            Also for alt/ctrl or shift-alt/shift-ctrl when clicking the zoom buttons (different from
            the above since no-shift/shift is already used to distinguish zoom from passband adjust.
            The tooltip popup when you mouse over the zoom buttons shows which type of passband
            adjustment will occur depending on the modifier keys.
            
        BFO/PBT indicator
            When you mouse over the passband with the shift key pressed the tooltip popups will
            include "BFO" or "PBT" to remind you of the alternate passband operation about to
            be performed when you begin click-dragging the passband.
    
    Added a "Close all admin connections" button to the admin connection exclusion panel.
        The usual admin page automatic reconnect will not occur. Whatever operation you were
        performing (e.g. DX label edit) will have to be repeated since it did not take effect.

    Fix for external ADC clock when Kiwi GPS correction disabled.
        
v1.557  Aug 30, 2022
    Make GPS clock corrections insensitive to type of connection to Kiwi.
    Added URL parameter "sndw=N" (N=0-4) to set alternate passband FFT filter window functions.
    Prevent admin "Daily restart?" option from triggering more than once during update window.

v1.556  Aug 27, 2022
    New feature: Send current tuned frequency as CAT "FA" command to attached USB tty device.
        Only works for serial devices at 115.2k baud due to realtime limitations
        (i.e. otherwise Kiwi audio and waterfall get glitched). Enabled on admin page, config tab.
        Format of sent string: "FAfffffffffff;" where "f" is 11-digit, zero padded frequency in Hz.
    
    New parameter returned by /status query: "clk_ext_gps=0,0" where first digit is =1 if an external
    ADC clock is being used, =0 otherwise. Second digit reflects state of admin config setting
    "GPS correction of ADC clock" with values: 0 = disabled, 1 = continuous, 2 = every even 2 minutes,
    3 = every 5 minutes, 4 = every 15 minutes, 5 = every 30 minutes.
    
    Hopefully, a fix for the long-standing problem of the system log filling up with these strange
    messages: "... action 'action 17' suspended, next retry is Fri Aug 26 03:17:10 2022 ..."
    Should not disturb anyone who has already implemented a fix by having made a custom change to
    the /etc/rsyslog.conf file.

v1.555  Aug 25, 2022
    Improvements to build process:
        Better error messages when admin update tab "check now" or "build now" fails.
        Similarly, better error messages in log file.
        Console tab, new button "re-clone Beagle_SDR_GPS".
            If the build returns the error message "Git clone damaged!" use this button to recover.
            The latest Kiwi software will be re-cloned from github.com
            Understand consequences before using:
            1. The Kiwi configuration information in /root/kiwi.config will NOT be changed.
            2. The Kiwi git clone (source files) in /root/Beagle_SDR_GPS will be completely removed
                and re-cloned. In the unlikely event you have made custom changes they will be lost.
                You must restart after the re-clone and let a full build occur.

    BBAI-64: Expand main memory available from 2 GB to 4 GB.

v1.554  Aug 15, 2022
    Admin page
        Console tab: added buttons with common commands, e.g. monitor build progress, disk free,
            check github.com reachability, ping kiwisdr.com sites.

        Config tab: "Downconverter high-side injection" checkbox will be disabled if antenna switch
            extension is in use since the switch now has per-antenna high-side injection control.

        Config tab: "GPS correction of ADC clock" is now a menu instead of an on/off switch.
            New options prevent corrections from disturbing WSPR-2 and FST4W reception.
            On the GPS tab, the correction count color after the displayed ADC clock frequency
            indicates if updates are currently allowed (green) or not (red).

    TDoA extension:
        Add "show all results" checkbox. If set this will cause the green markers displaying the
        most likely lat/lon positions to accumulate across successive runs.
        The "clear old results" button will erase all but the most recent likely position marker.

v1.553  Aug 10, 2022
    Fixed some problems with the ip blacklist for proxied Kiwis.

v1.551,552  Aug 7, 2022
    WSPR:
        Disable Kiwi public registration when all channels configured to use WSPR autorun.
            Since this is a nonsensical configuration not allowing any public connections.
        Fixed autorun bug where no spots with power < 10 dBm (0.01 W) were being uploaded, e.g. 22m
            This bug effected AUTORUN spots ONLY.
        Spots now uploaded with a version field of "1.4 Kiwi" and "1.4A Kiwi" instead of the
            previous "1.3 Kiwi". "1.4A" are spots from autorun. This allows pre/post v1.552
            spots to be distinguished using advanced searching on the site wspr.rocks
        Added admin/WSPR page option to log exact command used to upload autorun spots.
    
    Changes to support upcoming kiwirecorder enhancements.

v1.550  Aug 5, 2022
    Added "Downconverter high-side injection" checkbox to admin page, config tab.
        This is used in conjunction with the "Frequency scale offset (kHz, 1 Hz resolution)" field
        when a downconverter/transverter ahead of the Kiwi uses high-side LO injection to its mixer
        such that the spectrum applied to the Kiwi is "inverted". A good explanation of this
        phenomenon is here: www.rfcafe.com/references/electrical/spectral-inv.htm
        
        When the checkbox is set the waterfall essentially reverses all display bins/pixels and the
        audio channels swap I/Q channels meaning USB/LSB are swapped. Nothing about the polarity of
        the Kiwi frequency scale or display of the passband (yellow/green symbol) changes. The scale
        still has the lowest frequency on the left of the screen. And LSB is still on the left.
    
    The current VFO (A or B) will be copied to the other, i.e. "VFO A=B", when the 'N' key is used.
        There is also an option at the bottom of the frequency memory menu ('m' key) that does this.
    
    Admin page, WSPR extension and Public registration configuration:
        Show a warning message and disable public registration if it is enabled, and then
        WSPR autorun is setup for ALL the channels. This is effectively a misconfiguration since
        it is now impossible for any public connections to occur! Yes, there are number of publicly
        listed Kiwis in this condition (i.e. always a yellow-colored pin on map.kiwisdr.com)
    
    Sig gen extension:
        Changed "+/- 1k" buttons to be "+/- Step" (current step size).
        Frequency suffixes 'k' and 'M' can be used in Start, Stop and Step fields.
        
    The waterfall extension "interpolation" and "CIC comp" settings are now correctly initialized
        from the URL "wfi=" parameters if present.
    
    Cross compilation fix for macOS versions later than 10.15

v1.549  Jul 31, 2022
    Fixed WSPR extension bug causing interference between multiple autorun channels.
    Close extension web socket correctly for benefit of kiwirecorder using "--ext" option.

v1.548  Jul 29, 2022
    BBAI's should not use the code for BBG/BBB that switches from using /dev/spidev1 to spidev0 when
    Debian version > 9.

v1.547  Jul 28, 2022
    Fix bug preventing HFDL and timecode extensions from fully loading.

v1.546  Jul 27, 2022
    Fix audio bug caused by default audio suspension introduced in Firefox 103.

v1.545  Jul 27, 2022
    By request:
    Main control panel sliders (WF, Audio, AGC tabs) can now be adjusted by hovering over them and
        using the mouse wheel (or trackpad emulation of mouse wheel if enabled).
    Keyboard shortcut key 'n' toggles VFO A/B. Next to the 'm' key which shows the freq memory menu.
        As usual type 'h' or '?' to see a list of all shortcuts.
    Squelch "tail" menu value (audio tab) restored on page reload.
    New URL parameter "foff=freq_offset_kHz". Sets freq scale offset before loading user page.
        Same as right-click menu "set freq offset" and admin page, config tab.
        Restrictions:
            1) Can only be used from local network connections since it's a privileged (admin) operation.
            2) As with the right-click menu option, no admin page connections can be open.

v1.544  Jun 23, 2022
    Admin page, DX tab:
        Show solitary circle-plus icon if all band bar entries have been deleted.
        Don't allow last remaining DX label list or band service menu entries to be removed.
    
    Selcall extension:
        For Austravel Net frequencies show base names when their selcalls are used.
        Add Austravel Net channel numbers to the Selcall frequency menu.

v1.543  Jun 19, 2022
    Fixes:
        Fix passband initialization bug that occurs under certain circumstances.
        When snap-to-nearest enabled via right-click menu or occurs via shift-click in waterfall:
            Allows waterfall dragging and respects locked tuning mode.
    
    New URL parameters:
        "mem=f1,f2...  Set frequency memory menu to values given. Overrides any previously stored values.
        "z=[0-14]"  Set zoom level directly (historically could be done as part of "f=" parameter).

    Show ip blacklist file hash in /status inquiry (help determine if auto update is working).

v1.541,542  Jun 17, 2022
    FAX, FSK, NAVTEX extensions:
        Menu frequencies are now loaded from a file on kiwisdr.com so a new release is not required
        to update them. A backup copy is kept on the server in case the Kiwi has no Internet access.

    Selcall:
        Use published frequency values in menus at the expense of higher offset for some.
        Added Austravel Safety Net: www.austravelsafetynet.org.au/node/2
        Using clear button when map shown will clear map markers.
        Decodes calling when position info not included. Formats not decoded show raw values.

    Frequency memory:
        When you continuously tune by mousing down in the frequency scale (or on mobile by two-finger
            swiping on the waterfall) only the last frequency gets stored in the memory.
            Previously all the intermediate frequencies were stored and older memory entries would
            get flushed out (25 entry maximum).
        Fixed a bunch of other user interface issues with the frequency menu.

	Enable recently commissioned Galileo E34 (thanks Benjamin F4FPR/K5AW)

	Changed WSPR ISM_13 center freq from 13554.5 to 13555.4 (900 Hz higher) per forum thread:
	    forum.kiwisdr.com/index.php?p=/discussion/2649/wspr-22-m-ism-band-wrong-centre-frequency#p1

v1.540  Jun 14, 2022
    Fixed bug encountered when saving large configuration files.
        e.g. many band bar definitions (thanks Ben).

v1.539  Jun 12, 2022
    Automatic IP blacklist download added to admin network tab. Enabled by default.
    Selcall decoder improvements.

v1.538  Jun 5, 2022
    Yellow/green passband graphic on frequency scale:
        Fixed adjustment on mobile devices. Also made the "hit boxes" for the sloping part of
            the passband larger so it's easier to aim with your finger.
        Center frequency ("cf") tooltip: Added bandwidth ("bw") value.
        When cursor is in frequency scale mouse wheel adjusts passband width about center frequency.
            Previously a mouse wheel in the frequency scale did nothing.
            Keyboard shortcuts "p" & "P" did the same. And now ctrl-p will reset passband to the default.
            (can also be done by typing "/" in the frequency box or by right-click menu entry)
            Mouse wheel continues to zoom waterfall when cursor in waterfall or DX label area.

    When an admin connection closes unexpectedly an automatic page reload after 60 seconds will occur.
    FAX frequency updates.

v1.536-537  Jun 3, 2022
    Selcall development.

v1.534-535  Jun 1, 2022
    Added auto-zoom checkbox to FSK and NAVTEX extensions so the auto zoom which usually occurs
        can be disabled.
    Main control panel: Shift-clicking the circled +/- icons prevents frequency rounding that
        otherwise occurs. E.g. a 1 kHz step from 1234.56 goes to 1235.56 instead of 1235.00
    Selcall development.

v1.531-533  May 31, 2022
    DSC fixes.
    Selcall development.
    FAX frequency updates.

v1.530  May 28, 2022
    DSC fixes.

v1.529  May 27, 2022
    Digital selective calling (DSC) decoder added to NAVTEX extension.
    Added/fixed consistent demand and timed logging of decoded messages to
        ALE_2G, CW, FSK, HFDL, and NAVTEX extensions.

v1.523  May 10, 2022
    Fix race condition loading user page observed by KFS.
    iOS frequency entry: Use 10-digit keypad that includes decimal point.

v1.521,522  May 8, 2022
    Improvements to noise blanker/filter operation. All settings now saved in browser storage and
    recalled on page load. All settings can have default values setup by the Kiwi admin. This could
    be used to mitigate known, constant noise sources so for example the blanker is automatically
    active when first-time users connect.
    
    A new "default" button at the top of the extension panels cab be used to load the defaults.
    To simplify setting up the defaults the admin can use a new right-click menu entry
    "Save noise defaults" which copies the current settings into the Kiwi configuration.
    Admin password may be required (e.g. if not on the local network).

    Made photo uploads work again (admin page, webpage tab).

v1.520  May 7, 2022
    Added name/callsign entry field to end of "Users" tab on main control panel. Benefits mobile
    devices where the same field on the top bar could never be seen due to a small screen.

    Restore C-QUAM left/right channel assignment.

v1.519  May 6, 2022
    Mobile:
        When taping the frequency entry box Android devices go back to showing the
        telephone-style keypad instead of the alphanumeric one.

        A new touch gesture on the waterfall for smooth frequency tuning: Touch two-fingers
        horizontally, with a slight space between them, and swipe left/right to tune. Currently
        you have to single-finger swipe on the frequency scale to smoothly tune. But this is
        awkward because your finger always obscures the scale.
        
        For reference, these are the other waterfall gestures currently supported:
        Two-finger "pinch" in or out to zoom in or out centered on the passband.
        Two-finger touch to pop up the right-click menu.
        Single-finger touch to set the frequency, but with limited resolution unless zoomed in.

    Desktop:
        Pinch zooming on a trackpad now zooms centered on the passband (like it does on mobile).
        Previously it centered on the low-resolution pinch position instead. This caused the
        passband to frequently wander off the screen when zooming in. Zooming with a mouse
        scroll wheel is still centered on the cursor position which is typically what you want.
        
        Two-finger left/right swipe, as described above for mobile, does passband-centered
        zoom in/out (the existing two-finger up/down does cursor-centered zoom).
        Previously the behavior was undefined.

v1.518  May 4, 2022
    Fix frequency memory button.
    Fix capitalization of extension names.
    Samsung SMART-TV support.

v1.517  May 3, 2022
    Made spectrum color bar mode run as fast as "slow dev" mode. Left slow dev button in for now
    even though there's no reason for it anymore.
    Added frequency to spectrum display dBm tooltip (thanks Martin).
    Swapped C-QUAM AM stereo L/R channels based on a forum report (thanks nitroengine).
    More mobile issues fixed.

v1.516  May 2, 2022
    Fixed problem on Android < 8.1 where tap on frequency box brings up number entry pad
    then immediately closes it again so you're unable to enter a frequency.
    Fixed other mobile issues.

    Admin page, connect tab: Prevent entry of a local IP address into "Domain Name" or
        "Specified IP" fields. This should prevent entries on rx.kiwisdr.com that are unreachable
        because their links contain local IP addresses.

v1.515  April 30, 2022
    Modified the main control panel (user page, lower right):
        Moved cursor frequency sub-display (the one under the frequency entry box).
        Now it appears under the cursor while shift is held when mousing over the waterfall.
        This gives back substantial space in the panel for the new features described below.

        VFO A/B: Allows quick switching between two stored frequencies, including the mode and
        zoom settings. Updates to the current frequency/mode/zoom also updates the currently
        displayed VFO. This is an old ham radio concept.

        Memory menu: The aqua/orange frequency memory up/down buttons to the right of the
        frequency entry box have been replaced with a white, 3-bar icon that pops up a proper
        scrolling menu. The most recent frequency used is at the menu top aging downward.
        A "clear all" entry is at the bottom. The "m" keyboard shortcut key now toggles the menu.
        This key was previously "mute". But so was the "space" key which now remains for muting.
    
    Eliminated the short burst of audio heard when "&mute" is specified in the URL.
    
    Mobile device improvements:
        URL parameter "mobile" or "m" forces mobile behavior (e.g. my_kiwi:8073/?m)
            Use when the Kiwi code doesn't properly detect your mobile device.
        Stretch control panel width for 7" tablets (<= 600 pixel width in portrait mode).
        To help declutter the second line of the control panel:
            Remove the 9/10 kHz step button when not in the LW/MW bands.
            Don't show frequency link icon (green arrow) since it's fairly useless on mobile.
        For mobile Chrome give menus a white background to match the other browsers.
    
    Admin page, status tab: Show connecting browser info as a debugging aid.

v1.514  April 26, 2022
    Admin page, DX tab:
        Fix corruption of UTF-8 when uploading from .csv files.
        Allow uploading from non-local networks, e.g. allow an non-local admin connection to
            upload to a Kiwi at a remote site.
    
    Increased 24hr timeout repeated-connection auto ban limit from 2 to 5 retries.
    Fixed link in README.md file.

v1.513  April 22, 2022
    DX label CSV file import: commas are now an accepted field delimiter character.
        String fields are not required to be quoted (unless they contain the delimiter character).
        Spreadsheet CSV file write compatibility should be increased with this change.
    
    Mobile devices:
        The double-finger-tap menu (right-click menu on desktop) now highlights entries
        as you swipe over the menu. Just as the desktop menu does when swiping with the mouse.
    
    Added SAM PLL "Reset" button on audio tab. Use when the SAM PLL has wandered outside of its
        capture range. The previous workaround was to switch to AM then back to SAM to reset the PLL.
    
    Admin page, config tab: option to set 1 Hz frequency display resolution.
        Will eventually be a user control panel option for this, but that will have to wait for
        a general redesign of the control panel.

v1.511,512  April 20, 2022
    Fixed user connection page not loading when band bar has unknown service value set.
    Display nothing instead of "(no location)" when "show user geolocation info" is unchecked.

v1.510  April 18, 2022
    Fixed admin page, backup tab.

v1.508,509  April 16, 2022
    Fixed extension menu selection problems.
    Eliminate initial brief audio heard from 1 MHz.

v1.507  April 15, 2022
    Admin page, DX tab:
        New interface for editing the DX labels, band bars and "select band" menu entries.
        See the kiwisdr.com documentation and forum for details.
    
    Admin page, network tab, IP local blacklist:
        Support for whitelist entries. This is mostly for the benefit of the downloadable blacklist
        from kiwisdr.com  But if you need a whitelisted ip inside of a blacklisted ip range,
        prepend a plus sign (+) to the whitelisted ip and place it *after* the blacklisted range
        e.g. 1.2.3.0/24 +1.2.3.22  So 1.2.3.22 will be allowed even though the rest of the
        1.2.3.0 - 1.2.3.255 range is blocked.
    
    Repeated connections after the per 24hr time limit has passed will blacklist the IP address until
        the 24hr time limit table is next cleared (once a day).
    
    Admin page: show message when server closes connection (so you're not inputting into a dead page).

v1.505,506  March 31, 2022
    Fix bug with configuration file.

v1.504  March 20, 2022
    Fix for Kiwis using customized kiwi.config/config.js files (band bars and "select band" menu).

v1.502,503  March 19, 2022
    Fixes to better support admin page, control tab, "non-Kiwi apps" menu setting.

v1.501  March 18, 2022
    Fixed bug that sets volume to zero when volume cookie is not present.

v1.500  March 17, 2022
    Better indication of waterfall-only connections on the various connection status panels, 
        logs and the /users URL. See Kiwi forum for details.

v1.499  March 16, 2022
    Fixed bug that allowed maliciously crafted waterfall-only connections to not appear in any of
    the connection lists.
    
    Better guarding against maliciously crafted "name/callsign" field having no printable characters.

    DX label edit panel on user page:
        In addition to the existing HTML '<br>' sequence, entering '\n' into the ident field of a
        label will cause a line break.
    
        Entering the sequence '\n' into the notes field of a label will cause a line break in
        the popup text displayed on a mouse-over of the label. Previously it just displayed '\n'
        which wasn't helpful. HTML '<br>' also works.
    
    When an inactivity or connection timeout occurs any active audio recording is saved before
    the connection is closed. This fix does not also apply to FAX image recording.

v1.498  March 10, 2022
    Fix for menu rendering changes starting with Firefox 98.

v1.497  March 8, 2022
    Add freq offset adjustment to right-click menu (admin access only).
    Include freq_offset value (kHz) in /status result.
    TDoA: By default don't show sampling hosts on result map. A new result menu entry will do that.

v1.495,496  March 7, 2022
    Enhancements:
        Admin config tab:
            Based on the work of studentkra (thanks!) "frequency scale offset" values with 1 Hz
            resolution (admin config tab) are now supported. Previously were multiples of 1 MHz. 

        Band definitions when in "frequency scale offset" mode now works.
            So you can have e.g. an entry in kiwi.config/config.js like this:
            bands.push({ s:svc.A, min:144000, max:148000, region:'*', name:"2 meters" });
            The "select band" menu on the main control panel now only shows entries appropriate to
            the frequency scale.
        
        Admin config tab:
            Added option "Show user geolocation info". If unchecked shows "no location" in place
            of geolocation in connection list of main control panel and camp panel. Admin status
            tab and /users JSON query still shows geolocation.

v1.494  March 5, 2022
    Enhancements:
        Admin network tab: "Auto add NAT rule" should now remove rule from router
            when set to "no". (thanks magestic)

    Bug fixes:
        Zoom level specifier in URL working again, e.g. my_kiwi:8073/?f=7020cwz5 (thanks G4DYA)
        Connections when internal port = 80 configured working again. (thanks DL2SBA)

v1.493  March 3, 2022
    Admin page, network tab: In addition to the downloadable ip blacklist, add a separate, local,
        writeable list that won't get overwritten by the download.

v1.492  March 2, 2022
    Photo shown when connecting works again.
    Fix to allow more than 64 ip blacklist entries.

v1.490,491  February 28, 2022
    Admin page:
        When auto aperture is selected the waterfall floor/ceil defaults can be set.
        Added adjustment for name/callsign input field max length (16-64 chars, defaults to 16).
        Debian 10: Fixed bug when switching between DHCP/static IP mode.
    Last set volume is saved in a browser cookie and used for subsequent connects to the same Kiwi.
    Fixed automatic updating of the five IBP station labels (e.g. 14100 kHz).
    SSTV extension: Update frequencies in menu, add URL parameters to help panel.
    Misc bug fixes.

v1.489  February 1, 2022
    GPS: update Galileo sat table.
    Clean up default waterfalls by changing auto floor value from -10 to 0 dB.
    Fix MW band label bug found with really old config.js files.

v1.488  January 29, 2022
    Admin > Extensions > {ALE_2G, HFDL} "user enable" switch now works.
    Added US DEA to ALE 2G scan list (thanks Bob W).

v1.487  January 27, 2022
    Debian 10: Use connmanctl to change Ethernet ip address mode instead of editing the file
        /etc/network/interfaces and rebooting as is done with Debian 8 & 9.

v1.486  January 18, 2022
    Support for Debian 10 (Buster) on BBG/BBB.

v1.485  January 15, 2022
    IP address blacklist: auto detect when new blacklist available for download.
        Check is made when admin page loaded and a message displayed on network tab.
    Update EiBi B21 database to 5 January 2022 version.
    Bug fix: When multiple connections present prevent DX list editing from crashing server.

v1.484  January 7, 2022
    ALE_2G extension:
        display:N URL parameter works again.
        Admin page, extensions tab: added example of how to set USB mode.
    Fixed bug where starting a forced software build ("build now" button on update tab) would
        hang all connections, including admin connections, if user connections were present.
        User connections are now correctly kicked prior to the build (original behavior).

v1.483  January 2, 2022
    Admin page, log tab, "dump" button will show attempted blacklist connections for proxied Kiwis.
        Each individual connection attempt will no longer be shown in the log.
    Show ADC overflow count in /status URL ("adc_ov=NNN" parameter)
    When recording, prevent switching from mono to stereo modes (and vice versa).
    GPS: activate QZS-1R sat (contributed change, see: github.com/jks-prv/Beagle_SDR_GPS/pull/569)
    Admin console: process "remain on current line" (\r) sequences properly.

v1.482  December 22, 2021
    Better resistance to abusive connections.

v1.480,481  November 24, 2021
    HFDL extension: fixed bug preventing flight markers receiving an update turning blue again
    if they had already turned grey due to exceeding 10 minutes of inactivity.
    
    Antenna switch extension: Changed definition of what "user password only" means:
    Note: you don't have to re-install the antenna switch extension, but you must be running
    a version from April 2021 or later.
  
    On the admin page, "extensions" tab, "Antenna switch" entry is an option menu called
    "Allow antenna switching by". The last entry says "local connection or user password only".
    In this case user password has been changed to mean the time limit exemption password
    specified in the URL, e.g. "my_kiwi:8073/?ext=ant&pwd=the_password"
    The time limit password is setup on the admin page, control tab, bottom right of page.
    
    The other settings "everyone" and "local connections only" are unaffected by this change.
    The previous definition was confusing and didn't work in all cases.

v1.479  November 23, 2021
    HFDL extension improvements:
        Preliminary flight markers added. After 10 minutes without an update the marker is
        considered "old" and color changed to grey. Will change back to blue if a further
        update received. Use "clear old" button to remove grey markers.
        
        Use URL parameter "gs:0" to initially hide the ground station / AFT icons.

v1.478  November 22, 2021
    HFDL extension improvements:
        Added ACARS display menu option (does not show ACARS data without message content).
        Map AFT icons: highlight yellow on mouseover. Auto EiBi label / band zooming when clicked.
        
    Kiwi right-click menu no longer clips when positioned near screen bottom or right edges.

v1.477  November 21, 2021
    HFDL extension improvements:
        Added map of ground stations with active frequency table (AFT) icons sourced from
        decoded squitter messages. It can takes a number of minutes before sufficient squitter
        meesages are received to populate all the ground station icons.
        
        Small screens (laptops): because the area available for the waterfall is smaller than
        ever use the 'x' and 'y' keys to hide the various control panels and label bars.
        Click the "2" button at upper right to restore the map zoom/positioning.
        The "split" show menu option lets you view the map ans a small message window simultaneously.
        When you specify a band or frequency as an HFDL extension URL parameter EiBi labels
        and band zooming are automatically selected. No need to specify "dx=none,hfdl" anymore.
        
        The Kiwi icon shown when the "Show Kiwi" button is pressed does NOT reveal the precise
        location of the Kiwi. The lat/lon is rounded to the nearest 2 degrees which is approx.
        200 km of latitude and 100 - 200 km of longitude depending on the latitude location
        (recall that latitude lines converge at the poles). The purpose of showing the Kiwi
        location is to help understand what propagation might be in effect given the time-of-day
        at the Kiwi and transmission frequencies of the ground stations.
        
        No aircraft flight plotting on the map yet.

v1.476  November 18, 2021
    HFDL extension improvements:
        From dumphfdl: Added RSSI, noise floor, SNR estimate to message header.
    
    Fix bug that prevented some Kiwis from updating past v1.470

v1.475  November 17, 2021
    HFDL extension improvements:
        Now works for Kiwis using 3-channel/20.25 kHz mode.

v1.474  November 15, 2021
    HFDL extension improvements:
        New entries in the "Bands" menu that select an entire HFDL frequency band.
        Automatically sets the center frequency, zoom and switches to displaying only
        the EiBi database HFDL labels. Eliminates tedious manual setup. Can be set
        via URL parameter (see HFDL help panel).
    
    EiBi label database:
        Updated to B21 published 14 Nov 21 on eibispace.de

v1.473  November 13, 2021
    HFDL extension improvements:
        Additional processing of the messages appearing in the text window. The abbreviated 'DX'
        display now contains aircraft info. The 'squitter' display is more compact.
        Separate upload/download checkboxes to limit the message direction ('upload' are messages
        transmitted from the ground stations). Thanks Martin.
    
    EiBi label database:
        Clicking HFDL labels now selects IQ mode and the special USB passband used by HFDL.
        Labels which automatically open an extension on shift-click now mention this fact in the
        mouse-over popup (as a reminder). These are currently ALE, HFDL, Time, CW, FSK and FAX.
        Clicking ALE, HFDL and FAX labels set the special passbands used by the associated extensions.
        Clicking an HFDL label should also select the corresponding menu entry of the HFDL extension.
        Corrections from the HFDL version 51 system table were applied to the EiBi database.

v1.471,472  November 12, 2021
    HFDL extension preliminary release.
        Because the decoding happens entirely on the Beagle, and due to the buffering delay of
        delivering audio and waterfall to the browser, you will see the decoded text before the
        audio/waterfall occur. See:
        forum.kiwisdr.com/index.php?p=/discussion/2424/v1-472-hfdl-extension-preliminary-release/p1
    
    BBAI performance improvement. Specify correct compiler cpu type (cortex-a15) and
        vector floating point version (vfpv4) for the TI AM5729 cpu chip used by the BBAI.
        This causes the fused multiply-add instructions available in vfpv4 to be used.
        By comparison the BBG (TI AM3359 cpu chip) uses cortex-a8 and vfpv3.

v1.470  October 15, 2021
    EiBi database now used as a second source of (read-only) DX labels.
        For details shift-click in an empty spot of the DX label area above the frequency scale.
        Or use the first few entries in the right-click menu (two-finger tap on mobile) or use the
        keyboard shortcut "|". Then click the help button at upper right of the DX label edit panel.

v1.469  October 10, 2021
    Yellow passband symbol in the frequency scale -- usability improvements:
        * Dragging in the frequency scale will no longer stop if the mouse moves outside of the scale
        area (e.g. tracks below into the waterfall). Thus, mouse movement needs to be less precise.
        * When zoomed out, and the yellow passband symbol is small (narrow), the passband low/high
        adjustment "hotspots" (sloped regions on each end of the symbol) are disabled. This prevents
        accidental passband adjustment when all you really intended was to change the frequency.
        When the symbol is small it's impossible to see any passband adjustment anyway and there
        are several other ways of adjusting the passband via the keyboard.
        * To distinguish when the hotspots are enabled (i.e. when zoomed in sufficiently) the passband
        symbol is drawn in green instead of yellow.

    The default waterfall window function is now Blackman-Harris (thanks Martin)
        See here: http://forum.kiwisdr.com/index.php?p=/discussion/2386/waterfall-settings#p1
        
    DX labels: When saving changes large lists no longer stall the user interface.
    S-Meter extension: Shows ADC overflow as red markers in graph.

    "Utility database lookup" in the right-click menu has been removed because it seems the
        globaltuners.com frequency database is gone or hacked. Work is in progress to integrate the
        EiBi database as a selectable, second source of information for the DX/tag labels bar.
    
v1.468  October 2, 2021
    ALE 2G extension: added "lsb" URL argument that applies to URL scan list (if any).
    FSK extension: Get update of shift position crosshairs working again.

v1.467  September 27, 2021
    ALE 2G extension improvements:
        Significant performance improvements. It's now possible to run the ALE extension on
            4 channels (with reduced waterfall performance).
        Date, time and frequency condensed in message log.
        Periodic browser download of message log added. "record" checkbox becomes a menu containing
            audio and log recording settings. See extension help. Should help prevent losing log info
            on Kiwis that have connection timeouts. Note that ALE scanning resets any "inactivity"
            timeout but does not effect the per 24 hour connection limit (if present).
        Added a "Log" button to download the message log on demand.
        Display menu order changed: DX all +cmds +debug => DX +cmds all +debug
            This allows commands in the data stream to be added to the abbreviated messages of DX mode.
            If present, messages (i.e. AMD, DTM) are now included in DX mode.
        Some errors in the construction of greater than 3 character to/from calls were fixed.

v1.466  September 23, 2021
    ALE 2G extension menu bug fix.

v1.465  September 20, 2021
    ALE 2G extension
    Improvements:
        "Menus" setting renamed "Format".
        Format settings include sorting menu frequencies high-to-low in addition to menu collapse.
        Display settings improved. "DX" mode that produces fewer output lines per ALE transaction.
	    An optimized 600-2650 Hz passband is used. Passband restored when ALE extension closed.
	    Supports LSB mode in net/station database.
	    URL parameters
	        A multi-frequency, comma separated user scan list can be specified. See extension help.
	        Net names can have embedded spaces.
	    "Admin" menu renamed "Local" given that a user scan list from the URL will be added as the
	        first menu item (i.e. menu is no longer solely admin entries).
        Many new URL parameters. See extension help.

    Bug fixes:
	    Resumption of scanning is now delayed until any recording is finished.
	    Various problems with next/prev buttons fixed.

v1.464  September 15, 2021
    v1.463 introduced a bug whereby if a Kiwi has been configured with Unicode UTF-8 character sequences
    in the various description fields (e.g. receiver name, location, antenna or the additional HTML field)
    then those UTF-8 sequences became corrupted in the configuration files (kiwi.config/{kiwi,dx}.json)
    
    There are several consequences of this bug in v1.463:
    1) The admin page may only show the title tabs and nothing else (i.e. remainder of page fails to load).
    2) The Unicode replacement character en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specials_(Unicode_block)#Replacement_character
       (the '?' character inside a black diamond) will appear in place of the broken UTF-8 sequences.
       These replacements will appear on the page when connecting normally to the Kiwi and also on
       the various listing site (e.g. rx.kiwisdr.com) where the description fields are used.
    
    v1.464 has a workaround for this problem. The broken UTF-8 sequences in the configuration files
    will be replaced with the ASCII '?' character at Kiwi server startup time. This should allow the
    admin page to load. However, the Kiwi owner/admin will have to manually re-enter the desired Unicode
    characters as the bug caused the original Unicode to be lost. We apologize for this inconvenience. 
    
    If the Kiwi has automatic updates disabled there is obviously going to be a problem since the
    admin page may not load so that an update may be started. An alternative is to ssh/PuTTY directly into
    the Kiwi Beagle and update via Debian shell commands. If this is not possible there is also a hack
    to force an update even from the partially loaded admin page. Please email support@kiwisdr.com or
    ask on forum.kiwisdr.com for details about this method.

    Use floats instead of doubles in the ALE 2G extension.

v1.462,463  September 10, 2021
    ALE 2G extension preliminary release:
        A work-in-progress. Lots of issues no doubt. See KiwiSDR forum for discussion.
        Features
            Net/station menus
                Contents downloaded from kiwisdr.com on extension startup.
                    Hence menu updates do not require a new software release.
                "Collapse" mode to shown only scan or single-frequency entries.
                Admin menu populated with JSON content from Admin > Extensions > ALE_2G page.
            Variable scan speed and frequency filtering.
                Net menus contain lots of entries. Filter for time-of-day propagation considerations.
            Automatically record audio on ALE call establishment.
            Select different types of ALE messages to display.
    
    By request:
        Waterfall
            Timestamps
                When enabled they will appear on the waterfall left edge.
            New "waterfall" extension
                Select via "More" button on WFn tab or from the extension list.
                Set WF timestamp interval here or with the new "wfts=SECS" URL parameter.
                The aperture auto mode settings have moved here from the colormap extension.
                Adjustments for the FFT window function, interpolation and CIC filter.
            Right-click menu "save waterfall as JPG"
                Also saves frequency scale (Thanks Yuri!) and spectrum if open.
                Saved waterfall includes any timestamps.
                Filename format compatible with Kiwi audio recording and kiwirecorder.
                More waterfall is saved than seen in screen scrollable area.
                    With 1 Hz waterfall update rate you can capture over an hour of timestamped WF.
                Original feature was code contributed by Peter, VE3SUN.
        
        Audio tab
            Added option to disable passband overload mute feature. Disabled by default
            so as not to disturb audio recordings of extremely strong signals.

        International WSPR Beacon Project (IWBP) frequency hop mode
            For both the WSPR extension and autorun (background) mode there is a new
            band menu entry called "IWBP". This causes the receive frequency to automatically
            hop every two minutes according to the schedule here: github.com/HB9VQQ/WSPRBeacon
    
        S-meter extension now has timestamp option. UTC/local selected from waterfall extension.
        
        Admin > Config page
            Passband center field now has a "lock" checkbox which holds the pbc constant
            as the other fields are changed. Makes the passband center field behave like the
            old CW offset field, i.e. change it and everything moves with it. Also, if an
            asymmetrical passband is defined with a locked pbc, then changing the passband width
            maintains the asymmetry.
        
        Admin > Network page
            Added an IP address blacklist file download button. The blacklist file is
            curated from user contributions. See KiwiSDR forum for details.
        
        Admin > Update page
            Added new menu "after a restart": "install updates", "delay updates until overnight".
            Can prevent a pending update from being annoyingly installed just because you restarted.

    Bug fixes:
        Largest frequency step now 1 kHz in SSB modes (incorrectly changed to 5 kHz recently).

        The configuration files kiwi.config/{kiwi,admin,dx}.json are now pretty-printed with
            fewer URI character escapes. Improves readability and makes manual editing easier.

        IBP_scan extension (VE3SUN contribution) working again using current API.

        Vivado/Verilog (FPGA)
            Continuing changes to allow Kiwi to be used as a general FPGA development platform.
            Many fewer warning messages now from Vivado when building the Kiwi Verilog code.

v1.461  July 15, 2021
    Bug fixes:
        MW 9/10 kHz step applies up to 1710 kHz regardless of selected ITU mode.
        Default frequency step restored to 5 kHz.
        Mode selection allowed during recording except those that would change mono/stereo condition.

v1.460  May 24, 2021
    Fix needed by the KiwiSDR Android app (from the Google Play store).
    Match frequency step amounts between "snap to nearest" mode and L/R arrow keys.

v1.459  May 23, 2021
    Waterfall / spectrum:
        Fixed the CIC compensation added to the last release.

        Added waterfall interpolation URL parameter "wfi=N" e.g. kiwi:8073/?spec&wfi=13
        Also available as an API parameter on the waterfall web socket: "SET interp=N"
        Value N below. Add 10 to enable the CIC filter compensation.
        
        The value below answers the question: "What to do when multiple FFT values
        contribute to a single waterfall/spectrum pixel bin". In most cases the FFT
        is larger than the 1024 display pixels of the waterfall (or external application).
        
        0 take max (old and continuing server default for kiwiclient, external apps etc.)
        1 take min 
        2 take last 
        3 do drop sampling
        4 take cumulative moving average of values
        ...
        13  drop sampling + CIC compensation (new Kiwi browser interface default)

v1.457,458  May 21, 2021
    Waterfall / spectrum:
        Fixed low-level post-FFT artifacts spotted by Marco's SuperSDR app. Thanks Marco!
        Added CIC filter compensation to better level spectrum at top end.
    
    FAX extension:
        Added GM-11F Sevastopol 7090.9 kHz per fabrys on Kiwi forum. Thanks fabrys!

v1.455,456  May 19, 2021
    Admin page
        Config tab: Added button to reset passband fields to default values.
        Connect tab: Improved proxy setup UI.

    Right-click menu: Added "snap to nearest" mode. Setting is remembered/restored per Kiwi
        visited just like freq/mode etc. Waterfall cursor differs when snap mode active.
        When snap is active the freq step keys (j/i, left/right arrow keys) are modified so
        the ctrl/alt-key steps the smallest amount and the unmodified key steps the same
        amount as the snap (e.g. 9/10 kHz on MW). Usually the unmodified key step the
        smallest amount.

    Changes to more easily support general (even non-SDR) FPGA development.

v1.453,454  May 14, 2021
    Added default passband adjustment to admin page, config tab.
        As each passband parameter field is changed (low, high, center, width) the other
            fields will be automatically adjusted. So if you know you want a USB filter
            with a low frequency of 300 Hz that is 3300 Hz wide just enter those two fields
            and the high and width values will be derived. An error message will appear if
            you attempt to define an invalid passband.
        The former "CW offset" field has been removed. To set your desired CW offset
            simply set the default passband center frequency of the CW/CWN mode passbands
            to the offset value. E.g. If you want to hear a 1000 Hz tone in the CW modes
            set the passbands to have a 1000 HZ center.
        After the passband is changed on the admin page, existing user connections will have
            to reload the page to get the new passband values.

v1.452  May 4, 2021
    Improvements to API to prevent abuse of disabled DRM mode.

v1.451  April 13, 2021
    Admin log tab:
        By request: add option to not log connections from local ip addresses.
            Keeps the log cleaner when you have something like FT8Skimmer connecting frequently.
        Show "L" in log tab for messages that will be sent to syslog.
            Additional debug messages are always shown in the log tab. This will better
            explain which ones are actually going to the syslog.
    
    On BBAI handle change to .dtb (device tree) file installation first seen in the
        Beagle release of Debian 9.13

v1.450  April 5, 2021
    Fixed SNR calculation when downconverter offset in effect (thanks Pierre).
    A non-public Kiwi will show now correct values for user/user_max in /status.

v1.449  April 3, 2021
    SNR measurement adjustments on admin page control tab:
        Adjust recording interval: 1, 4, 6 or 24 hours per measurement.
            One week's worth of data is retained in the rolling buffer.
            New JSON field "seq" (incrementing) to help identify most recent entry.
        In addition to existing frequency measurement intervals 0-1800 and 1800-max kHz
            added 0-1800, 1800-10000 10000-20000 and 20000-max
            These are similar to what Marco uses (sibamanna.duckdns.org/sdr_map).
        Selectable local/UTC timestamp.

    More support for antenna switch extension changes.

v1.448  April 2, 2021
    Support for antenna switch extension changes.

v1.447  March 30, 2021
    WSPR autorun restart now correctly zeros decode counters.
    Trim trailing newlines from command API (accommodates commands sourced from files).

v1.446  March 28, 2021
    WSPR extension:
        By request: Added 6 & 13 MHz ISM bands (UK balloon-mobile operation).
        Can restart autorun decoders via an admin page button instead of server restart.
    
    Windows 10 audio "popping" problem:
        Looked for memory addressing errors and leaks with the Clang address sanitizer.
        A few minor issues fixed but nothing that changes the audio problem.
        This was expected, but also had to be ruled out.

v1.445  March 24, 2021
    SNR measurement:
        Take transverter frequency offset into account.
        Display SNR value(s) on user (top bar) and admin pages (status tab).

    Added SAM PLL loop control to audio tab.
        Has a slow loop setting "DX" that can be used to better track weak stations.

v1.444  March 23, 2021
    Include two most recent SNR values in /status query. This implies all the SNR values
        for public Kiwis will be aggregated in the rx.kiwisdr.com/index.html file
        HTML comments.
    
    TDoA extension:
        Improved help panel contents.
        Added warning against prematurely using too many sampling stations because of
            the large number of computation timeouts we see on the server.

v1.443  March 22, 2021
    Added automatic SNR measurement:
        Every 6 hours (4 times daily) a Kiwi will connect to a free channel (if available)
        and measure its own SNR. These results are available in JSON format from the
        URL: my_kiwi:8073/snr (adjust Kiwi name and port number as required).
        This URL is publicly accesible. Disable on the admin page, control tab if you
        don't want to share this information.
        
        The measurement details can be easily changed. Suggestions welcome.
        SNR is currently defined in the same way as used by the sites snr.kiwisdr.com
        and snr2.kiwisdr.com, i.e. waterfall dBm values, sorted, noise = 50th percentile
        value (median), signal = 95th percentile value, SNR = signal - noise.
        Two measurement bands are recorded: 0-30 MHz and 1.8-30 MHz in an attempt to
        filter out the AM BCB. The JSON data also contains min/max dBm values and a
        timestamp (local time unless the "UTC" value is set).
    
    Added "reload page" button to queueing panel ("camp" parameter is removed from URL)
        Use to quickly access any Kiwi redirection that might be available.

    Autoscale button and aperture auto mode now disregard masked areas from calculations.

    Admin page UI changes:
        GPS RSSI now red color for sats not actually acquired (i.e. no subframe decoding)
        Registration now requires a valid location field (for benefit of map.kiwisdr.com)

v1.442  March 16, 2021
    Audio camping improvements & bug fixes:
        Added S-meter.
        Highlight channel (RXn) being camped.

    S-meter correctly switches between showing original and new CW AGC threshold.
    
v1.441  March 15, 2021
    Audio camping bug fixes:
        URL redirect now respects URL camp parameter. More work needed for other cases.
        Audio now plays on Safari.
    
    Added separate CW AGC threshold control.
        Typically a lower AGC threshold is required for very narrow passband settings to
        avoid low sensitivity. Since narrow passbands are most often associated with the
        CW/CWN modes it was decided to add a separate AGC threshold control active only in
        those modes. The original threshold control applies to all other modes.
        The two are stored in their own separate browser cookies.
    
    Fixed bugs in the Audio FFT display (the one that appears in 8-channel mode when more
    than two channels are busy, or if the URL "no_wf" parameter is given):
        The LSB passband is drawn in the same place as the actual FTT output.
        The FFT display bins were flipped to be correct (i.e. low vs high frequency).
        Autoscale mode works better than before.
    
    Disabled compression ("comp") button in DRM/SAS/QAM modes since it has no meaning
        and effect in these modes.
    Fixed shift-click in SWBC bands not selecting nearest 5 kHz boundary.
    Fix long audio latency on browsers that display "Click to start OpenWebRX" overlay.

v1.439,440  March 14, 2021
    Channel queuing and camping:
        When all the Kiwi channels are busy(*) it is now possible to enter a queue to wait
        for the next available channel. The queue is FIFO and multiple parties can
        occupy the queue (your queue order will be shown).
        
        If all channels are busy you can also now "camp" on an existing connection and
        hear the audio of that channel. The only adjustment is to change the audio volume.
        Otherwise you experience all the changes performed by the owner of the channel
        (tuning, mode, etc).
        
        You can also be in the queue waiting for your own channel while camping.

        It is possible to use camping even if free channels are available by connecting
        using the URL parameter "camp", e.g. my_kiwi:8073/?camp
        You might want to do this if you know there is already a connection you want to
        camp on, but there are also free channels you don't want to unnecessarily occupy.

        In theory camping requires only slightly more resources because the audio stream
        is simply being duplicated and sent to the camper's network connection.
        The Kiwi admin can configure the maximum number of campers allowed, including zero.
        
        Later on we can look at adding audio-related features to camping that only require
        browser/javascript resources, hence place no additional load on the Kiwi server
        (e.g. S-meter, recording, audio FFT waterfall/spectrum display).
        
        These changes are complex and will no doubt have bugs and corner cases to fix.
        
        (*) or unavailable due to password protection on those Kiwis that have split
        public/private channels.

    Added C-QUAM AM stereo mode to SAM mode button which now cycles as: SAM/SAL/SAU/SAS/QAM
        Based on the work of Github user MaPePeR, see: github.com/jks-prv/Beagle_SDR_GPS/issues/395
        Remember that alt-click will toggle the mode buttons backwards, e.g.
        alt-click on SAM wraps back to QAM (faster than clicking forward on SAM 4 times).
        The same applies to the keyboard shortcut: shift-A is SAM mode forward to SAL
        alt-shift-A is SAM backward to QAM.
    
    Apply ITU region selection to band display (e.g. 40m ham band now stops at 7.2M for R1)
        It is possible this change will cause problems if extensive customization of
        the kiwi.config/config.js file has been made by the user. Please let us know if
        this happens to you.

v1.438  March 7, 2021
    Add admin page config tab option to disable AGC threshold display on S-meter.
    Simplify record icons for audio and FAX files.
    Restore frequency entry <form> interface for benefit of CATSync app.

v1.437  March 6, 2021
    From Marco, IS0KYB (thanks Marco!)
        AGC threshold bar added to S-meter:
            The white bar appearing above the green S-meter bar is the AGC threshold value
            (from control panel AGC tab). The threshold dBm value can read on the
            S-meter scale in equivalent S-units.
        Passband overload mute:
            Mutes the audio when the signal level in the passband exceeds a set value.
            The value is defined by a new setting on the admin page config tab.
            When active a "!" appears in place of the mute icon on main control panel.
            Useful for example when a nearby transmitter would otherwise result in a
            loud annoying signal. Mute recovery time uses existing squelch tail setting.
            
    Added list of code contributors to _COPYRIGHT file.
        Work in progress. If we missed your code contribution please email us.
        We have hundreds of github issues and thousands of emails and forum posts to review.

    Typing '/' alone into frequency box will restore the passband to the default value
        for the current mode. Shortcut to shift-clicking over a mode button.
    FFT extension: add help button, URL parameters, preset for RTZ.
    Add mouseover popups to more buttons and menus on main control panel.
    Removed more references to sdr.hu

v1.436  February 23, 2021
    Minor improvements.

v1.435  February 19, 2021
    Signal generator extension working again.
        Still requires admin password (local network exemption applies).
        Now only works with channel 0 so using it won't disturb other channels listening
        in a multi-channel environment.
    Change all NCOs to use 48-bit phase registers.
    Timecode extension: use RBU's lower sideband as it seems stronger.
    Misc code cleanup.

v1.434  February 13, 2021
    Timecode extension bug fixes and improvements.

v1.433  February 12, 2021
    Timecode extension improvements:
        Support for JJY(Japan), RBU(Moscow), RTZ(Irkutsk), BPC(China) added.
        While running AGC delay is temporarily increased to improve noise immunity.

v1.432  February 10, 2021
    Fix bug with long name/callsign entries containing Unicode characters.

v1.431  February 6, 2021
    Use new format NDB database at rxx.classaxe.com
    New URL parameter user=... or u=... that sets name/callsign field in top bar.
        Useful when the field is not shown on narrow displays but you want to set it.

v1.430  January 30, 2021
    Make de-emphasis option simply on/off since we've been unable to figure out why
        the 75/50 usec filter coefficient code doesn't work anymore.

v1.429  January 16, 2021
    FAX: added Vanino Radio 6455 to Asia menu per forum user Fabrys.
    By request: add value 1400 to MTU menu on admin page network tab.

v1.428  December 17, 2020
    Reliability fixes.

v1.427  November 29, 2020
    Added support for antenna switch extension changing frequency scale offset.
    Added gps_date parameter to /status query. "gps_date=<enable>,<set>" where <enable> and
        <set> are digits '0' or '1' indicating if gps is enabled to set date/time, and if
        the set has actually occurred.

v1.425,426  November 26, 2020
    Channel nulling, preliminary release
        See forum post: http://forum.kiwisdr.com/discussion/2169/early-demonstration-of-channel-nulling#p1
    
    Audio FFT extension:
        Rename and expansion of former "integrate" extension.
        Adds continuous audio FFT and audio spectrum modes to existing integration mode.
        The audio spectrum function is particularly useful in visualizing the effectiveness
            of the new channel nulling feature of SAM mode.

    Admin security tab: added option to enable/disable console tab access from the local
        network. This in response to a few Kiwis that still have trouble determining
        their local network address, e.g. when using unsupported WiFi dongles.

    Prevent open menus from unexpectedly closing when colormap averaging event occurs.
    Update embedded URLs pointing to the forum.

v1.422,423,424  November 16, 2020
    Squelch (all modes) will pause the record function (red circle to left of speaker icon)
        when the squelch is open. The record icon also changes to white.
        This is consistent with the other UI elements that change to white when the
        squelch is open. Kiwirecorder behavior is not effected.

v1.421  November 11, 2020
    Admin config tab: prevent waterfall min dB from being set >= max. Otherwise this case
        causes the user interface to hang on page load.

v1.419,420  November 10, 2020
    Added a simple RSSI-based squelch for the non-NBFM modes.
        See audio tab of control panel. Based on the squelch from kiwirecorder.

v1.418  November 5, 2020
    Changes to help avoid running out of memory during builds under certain conditions.

v1.417  October 30, 2020
    Allow GPS to set date/time. See admin page, GPS tab, new setting on top bar.
        Defaults to false.
        
        Before this can happen the GPS-to-UTC correction must be received from the GPS
        navigation message stream. This can take from zero to 12.5 minutes depending on
        the sat page/subframe transmission phase. The date correction has been tested
        using navigation data streams from Navstar, QZSS and Galileo.
        
        Only one date correction is performed per restart. However the previous constant
        correction of the system time (but not date) whenever it differs more than
        2 seconds from GPS time is still in effect.

    Added FAX extension frequencies for CN stations XSQ and an UNID per forum user Fabrys.

v1.416  October 27, 2020
    Make drmrx.org the default DRM schedule database.

v1.415  October 20, 2020
    Admin network tab: added Ethernet MTU selection option of 1440 (default 1500) which
        seems to help some installations using 4G Internet connections.
    Bug fixes:
        Well-known DNS server 1.1.1.1 is always added to end of /etc/resolv.conf file.
        "Photo max height" field can no longer be set blank (which prevented page load).

v1.414  October 10, 2020
    Added initial waterfall colormap selection to admin page "config" tab.
        Some people now prefer to use the SdrDx colormap and have it shown to
        new visitors as the default.

v1.413  October 10, 2020
    Include Kiwi's set UTC date/time in /status URL response.

v1.412  October 8, 2020
    Another fix for GPS TOD correction.
    Do URL redirection during updates and backups.

v1.410,411  October 7, 2020
    GPS time-of-day (TOD) correction now works even if the Kiwi date is set incorrectly.
        Previously the Kiwi week day number had to match GPS for TOD correction to work.
        The GPS code currently does not know how to set the Kiwi date because it does
        not parse the GPS almanac.

v1.409  October 3, 2020
    Added "Initial aperture" setting to admin page config tab. This setting determines
    which waterfall colormap aperture mode, manual or auto, is used as the default for
    "first time" visitors to your Kiwi. More precisely, for any connection to your Kiwi
    where the "last aperture set" cookie has not been previously set ("first time"
    visitors are a subset of that definition).    

v1.408  September 24, 2020
    TDoA:
        Easier way to select single "reference location" subcategory (e.g. "utility").
            Previously you had to select all subcategories by checking the main
            "reference locations" checkbox. Then uncheck all the subcategories you
            _didn't_ want. Now simply de-select all subcategories by unchecking the
            "reference locations" checkbox and check the subcategories you want.

        The reference locations, utility subcategory has been updated to include 5 known
            and suspected high-frequency stock trading (HFT) transmitting sites in the
            USA directed towards Europe. If you know of others please post on the forum.

v1.407  September 22, 2020
    Keyboard shortcuts:
        Space bar now mutes in addition to existing 'm' key.
        '!' toggles the waterfall aperture manual/auto menu.
        'b' 'B' scrolls through the "select band" menu. The frequency update is immediate.
        'e' 'E' scrolls through the "extension" menu. The extension open is delayed
            slightly so you can scroll through the menu to the desired entry.
            These keys can be used while an extension is open to select a new extension.
            As always hit the escape key to close the open extension.

v1.404,405,406  September 20, 2020
    DRM extension:
        Condense schedule format:
            Station name now overlaps timeline.
            Links are now info buttons.
    
    Aperture auto mode no longer disturbs manual mode WF max/min settings.
    Expand range of SdrDx colormap a little.
    In stat tab status message replace sdr.hu with rx.kiwisdr.com

v1.403  September 17, 2020
    DRM extension:
        Added schedule database selection menu. Includes database from drmrx.org
    
    Waterfall/spectrum/colormap improvements:
        New terminology, colormap "aperture" (what the WF max/min controls really define).
            A colormap spectrum bar now appears above the WF sliders.
            It is similar to the bar that appear on the right of the spectrum display.
            It changes as you adjust WF max/min in manual aperture mode or automatically
            in auto aperture mode (see next). Markers appear at the WF max/min points
            whereas the bar itself covers a fixed -140 to -25 dBm.

        Added aperture auto mode to existing manual and one-shot (auto-scale button) modes.
            On the main control panel WF tab there is a new menu "aperture".
            *** Auto mode is the new default, but the choice is saved across page reloads.
                This is designed to help always keep the waterfall dynamic range optimal
                for folks who never get around to learning how to use the WF max/min
                sliders or even the "auto-scale" button.

            In auto mode the WF max/min sliders become WF ceil(ceiling)/floor.
                This is the amount of "headroom" to create above and below the
                automatically calculated WF max/min values.

        Added colormap control extension consisting of two parts:
            1) Aperture auto mode controls.
                The averaging algorithm/parameter choices are the same as for the
                waterfall and spectrum averaging (on the WF tab of main control panel).
                When in auto mode the calculated max/min values are shown, those that are
                computed plus the selected floor/ceiling headroom.
                In auto mode the "auto scale" button on the main control panel lights up
                to remind you that auto mode is in effect.
                When auto mode averaging is turned off the max/min values are only
                recalculated when the waterfall zoom, pan or center frequency changes.

            2) A "colormap designer" for creating custom colormaps.
                A work-in-progress. The details of this will probably change.
        
        Added new colormap from the SdrDx project.
        
    Admin interface:
        Disallow public listing unless at least one password-less channel is available.
        Warn about creating URL redirect cycles.
        Display UTC/local time on admin status page.

    Use string hashing for faster API command decoding.
    Many other bug fixes. As usual see the Github commit log.

v1.401,402  August 11, 2020
    DRM extension:
        Added time & frequency sorted schedules.
        Removed menu-based station selection in favor of schedule selection.
    
    Fixed update detect mechanism that is failing for certain cities inside China.

v1.400  August 7, 2020
    Added code to removed another virus.
    Synchronize backup DRM schedule.

v1.399  August 2, 2020
    Support multiple IPv6 addresses on network interfaces.
    Better handling of user password panel timeout.

v1.398  July 3, 2020
    Auto update: added check for filesystem full condition.
    Fix to IQ balance (DC offset) old offset detection and correction.

v1.397  June 18, 2020
    Fixed problem when using double-quotes in some admin page fields.
    SIGHUP of Kiwi server creates kiwi.config/info.json file with full precision GPS location.
    Added Safety/NBDP frequencies to Navtex HF menu (thanks @rikvanriel)

v1.396  June 12, 2020
    Remove more references to sdr.hu
    Minor fixes/improvements (see commit log).

v1.395  June 2, 2020
    Remove references to sdr.hu
    Prevent "make install" from failing on BBAI if window system is not installed.

v1.394  May 31, 2020
    Noise blankers and filters:
        Added the spectral noise reduction filter by Frank, DD4WH and Michael, DL2FW, via the
        Teensy-ConvolutionSDR and UHSDR projects. See: github.com/df8oe/UHSDR/wiki/Noise-reduction
        This noise filter works really, really well. Especially for voice signals.
        A good alternative to the LMS filters.
    
    Note that the Wild blanker and all the noise filters (wdsp, LMS, spectral) don't currently work
    with the modes: IQ, SAS and DRM (i.e. the 2-channel IQ modes). This will be fixed at some point.

v1.392,393  May 28, 2020
    Noise blankers and filters:
        Added the Michael Wild noise blanker. Not a lot of operating experience with this yet.
        It seems not to work on some noise sources compared to the standard blanker.
        A good test source is 100 kHz Loran-C in AM mode using a UK Kiwi.
        Increase the gate time (standard blanker) or impulse samples (Wild blanker) to
        account for the longer Loran-C pulses compared to the usual impulse noise.

        Fixed wdsp filter: the control sliders had no effect previously!
        Now it works quite well. You have to adjust the gain carefully to prevent overload.

        Added test pulse gain and pulse width controls. And also whether the pulse is
        applied before or after the passband filtering. The Wild blanker seems only
        effective on post-filter pulses. Probably because the filter is turning the
        pre-filter step function pulses into nicer band-limited pulses.

v1.391  May 23, 2020
    User interface changes:
        SAL, SAU mode passband image will only show single sideband (just like LSB, USB).
        Ctrl/alt-click on mode button toggles modes backwards (most useful with SAM modes).
        Same works with keyboard shortcuts, e.g. ctrl/alt-A toggles SAM modes backwards.
    
    Noise blankers and filters:
        Reworked the audio tab user interface to support multiple blanker/filter algorithms.
        New algorithms planned but not yet available are greyed-out in the menus.
        From Warren Pratt's wdsp package added the variable-leak LMS algorithm.
    
    Bug fixes:
        Audio recordings made in SAS (synchronous AM stereo) mode now work.
        Fixed problem with ITU region 2 Kiwis and shift-clicking waterfall in 75/80m band segment.
        from lazywalker: fixed problems with frequency memory and reload value when transverter offset used.

v1.390  April 23, 2020
    Performance improvements:
        Suggested by @howardsu on Kiwi forum: remove -DDEBUG so assert()'s are not evaluated.
            Added new "make debug" target to revert to compiling with -DDEBUG defined.

        Christoph's cross-compilation changes: added "make xc" target that allows cross-compiling on
            development host. Alternative to slow compiles on Beagle during development.
            See file CROSS_COMPILE for complete details.
    
    Added synchronous AM (SAM) demodulators from Warren Pratt's wdsp package via the
        Teensy-ConvolutionSDR implementation: github.com/DD4WH/Teensy-ConvolutionSDR
        See the Kiwi operation manual for more information: kiwisdr.com/info#id-faq-sam
        Synchronous AM modes: SAM, SAL, SAU, SAS
    
    User interface changes:
        Use keyboard shortcut 'A' to toggle the SAM modes (sorry, 's' and 'S' were taken).
            As always type 'h' or '?' to see the list of all keyboard shortcuts.
        Bugfix: Adjusting the passband via a "/width" or "/low,high" entry in the
            frequency box is now "sticky" i.e. remembered when returning to the mode.
            Just like when changing the passband via the 'p' and 'P' keyboard shortcuts.
            Restore as usual by shift-clicking on the mode button.

v1.389  April 12, 2020
    Added to popup menu: "edit last selected DX label". This means you can now edit DX labels
    on mobile devices.

v1.388  April 11, 2020
    Desktop UI improvements:
        Added "tuning lock" to right-click popup menu. When active a single-click in waterfall
        or DX label area will briefly show a "tuning locked" overlay. Should perhaps be extended
        to include clicks in tuning scale. Does not effect other methods of tuning, e.g. entry in
        frequency box, click on +/- step buttons.

    Mobile UI improvements:
        Double-tap/touch brings up popup menu (same menu as right-click on desktop).
        Has tuning lock function same as desktop.
        Two finger pinch-in/out gesture will zoom the waterfall in/out. Tested on iOS & Android.

v1.387  April 10, 2020
    Admin page control tab:
        By special request, added ability to limit number of simultaneous non-Kiwi API connections
            (e.g. kiwirecorder). This works in the same way (and overrides) the TDoA extension
            setting that limits the number of simultaneous TDoA connections.
    DX label edit:
        Passband frequencies can be entered using "k" and "M" suffixes for kHz and MHz.
        I.e. "2100" and "2.1k" are equivalent, as are "1200000", "1200k" and "1.2M".
        However subsequent display of the passband field is always in Hz.
        So after entering "-2.1k, 1.2M" on the next edit the field will display "-2100, 1200000" (Hz).

v1.386  April 6, 2020
    Fix passband setting problem.

v1.385  April 5, 2020
    DRM extension fixes and improvements:
        Respect passband set in dx labels and in URL.
            E.g. you have a dx label with mode=DRM and passband=-4.5k,4.5k like you might use
            with 9 kHz DRM mode CNR 6030 kHz. You don't want the DRM extension to override that
            passband and set to the default 10 kHz. Similarly if you've set a passband in the URL
            e.g. "my_kiwi:8073/?pb=-4.5k,4.5k&ext=drm" (alternatively "pb=9k")
        Fixed bug causing "out of tasks" panic when DRM had been started and stopped on
            multiple channels over time.

        Fixed service text message display.
    Web server caching control added to admin webpage tab.
        Set to "No" when when there are caching problems in your
        network path, e.g. user interface icons don't load.
    Adding a time limit (i.e. zero to non-zero) won't kick local connections anymore.

v1.374  January 19, 2020
    New, more accurate TDoA algorithm (thanks Christoph).
        Use "Old algorithm" checkbox under TDoA options to revert.

    DRM extension fixes and improvements:
        Special USB IQ passband for WINB to help initial sync.
        Scrolling in the schedule window shouldn't get "stuck" anymore.
        Prevent weak signals from occasionally causing crashes in the AAC superframe processing.
        Save cpu cycles by dropping internal processing rate from 48 kHz to 24 kHz.

v1.368,369  January 11, 2020
    DRM extension fixes and improvements:
        AGC was missing from DRM IQ input. Should now work as well as Dream with weaker signals.

v1.365,366,367  January 10, 2020
    Decouple rx.kiwisdr.com and sdr.hu registration.
        Can register on either or both.
        Rename admin page tab "sdr.hu" to "Public".
        API key only applies to sdr.hu
    Allow limited regular connections when DRM active.
    Build DRM files only when needed.
    Consider local timezone when scheduling updates (i.e. 1AM - 6AM local, not UTC).
    Log build messages to /root/build.log file to aid in build failure determination.
    Improve web server caching (more closely follow web caching standards).
    More protection against users making invisible connections and other hacks.

v1.356  December 3, 2019
    Additional Kiwi API input validation.

v1.353,354  November 29, 2019
    Security fixes. See the Kiwi forum for more information.
    One-time check of Linux/Debian "root" and "debian" account passwords.
        If they are unset or the defaults they are set to the Kiwi admin password (if set)
        else the Kiwi's serial number. See the Kiwi log for a description of the action taken.
    Added code to remove a new bot-virus reported on one Kiwi that had its ssh port open to the
        Internet and root account unprotected (no password set, hence the reason the
        above change was implemented).

v1.352  November 24, 2019
    Timecode extension improvements.

v1.351  November 24, 2019
    Fixed another waterfall panning bug.
    Fixed startup glitch in spectrum peak hold function.
    Preliminary release: Time station decoder (timecode) extension.
        Many missing features and has known problems.

v1.348,349,350  November 23, 2019
    Admin config tab: add initial CW offset field.
        Kiwi owners/admins: If you don't like the default 500 Hz this is where you change it.
        Non-owner/admin users of a Kiwi have to change the passband manually as usual.
    Admin extension tab: add user enable for each extension.
        Don't want users using a particular extension on your Kiwi? Disable them here.
        Only works for internal extensions currently (i.e. not for the antenna switch extension).
        Local connections (same network) are exempt from these restrictions.
    Fixed specifying frequency in URL when configured in transverter/downconverter mode.
    Fixed premature end of waterfall panning when dragging near left edge.
    Improved behavior when dragging in the frequency scale.

v1.347  November 16, 2019
    WSPR extension & autorun works again with transverter/downconverter mode.

v1.346  November 15, 2019
    Fixed return/newline processing causing output line overwrites in fsk/navtex/cw extensions.

v1.345  November 10, 2019
    Fixed bug with waterfall disable mode on admin page.

    Emergency rollback to v1.339 state.

v1.341  November 8, 2019
    A hopefully more correct fix for the v1.2 update problem.
    Fixed synchronization problem causing IQ display instability with VLF/LF stations.

v1.340  November 8, 2019
    Fix for broken updating from v1.2 factory distro.

v1.339  November 3, 2019
    Incorrectly used RX2_STAGES = 4 for all FPGA configuration builds instead of original = 5
        (rx14_wf1 config for BBAI had to use RX2_STAGES = 4 to fit in the FPGA)
    Due to the additional noise caused by RX2_STAGES = 4 the BBAI rx14_wf1 config has to be
        changed back to RX2_STAGES = 5 and downgraded to rx14_wf0 (i.e. no waterfall,
        only audio FFT for all 14-channels) to fit in the FPGA.

v1.338  November 3, 2019
    Launch WSPR autorun at correct time.

v1.337  November 2, 2019
    Added waterfall filtering (averaging).
    Added inactivity timeout warning panel.
    CW decoder: better default threshold value.
    Admin console: ANSI color escape support.
    Faster builds via parallel Make jobs.

v1.336  October 25, 2019
    Make ip blacklist work with proxy.

v1.335  October 11, 2019
    Change GPS acquisition task scheduler hold-off time constant.

v1.334  September 26, 2019
    Fix to micro-SD card backup creation for people who have unwisely manually upgraded
        beyond the Kiwi Debian 8.5 distro.
    Don't do geolocation if client browser is Firefox version <= 28 due to strange failures
        involving interaction between ad blockers, CORS, AJAX and the geoloc servers.
    WSPR: added admin page option to log decodes to syslog.
    Added users query e.g. "my_kiwi:8073/users" Can only use with Kiwis on your local network.
        Result is JSON with some fields URI encoded. See forum for details.

v1.333  September 19, 2019
    Added debugging to proxy service.

    For kiwirecorder waterfall better compatibility with Kiwis running older software versions.

v1.328  September 5, 2019
    New API allowing kiwirecorder to specify waterfall center frequency.

v1.326,327  September 3, 2019
    TDoA: Preliminary KML support changes.

v1.323,324,325  August 31, 2019
    FAX extension:
        Display correct aspect ratio (i.e. circle on FAX should now appear circular).
        Reduce cpu load which prevents problems when running on 3-channel / 20.25 kHz Kiwis.

v1.322  August 30, 2019
    FAX extension:
        Increased passband for sharper FAX images.
        Realtime scheduling changes needed by auto alignment.

v1.320,321  August 29, 2019
    FAX extension:
        Fixed a bug with auto alignment.
        "use phasing" checkbox renamed "auto align".
    S-meter extension:
        Added more marker interval values.

v1.319  August 28, 2019
    Fixed bug in audio FFT mode. If you visited a new Kiwi for which no FFT WF max/min cookie
        values had ever been stored you'd always get a black waterfall until clicking "Auto Scale"
        and then reloading the page.
    FAX extension:
        Now has a 2k line scroll-back buffer.
        Added phasing and autostop capabilities. Phasing will automatically align (shift) the image
        horizontally if the phasing signal at the beginning of the transmission is clear enough.
        Autostop will stop the image buffer updating if the FAX start/stop tones are clear enough.
    S-meter extension:
        Now has stop/start and "mark" buttons.

v1.318  August 27, 2019
    FAX extension:
        Add LPM (lines per minute) selection. Automatically set 60 LPM for JJC/JSC
        Frequency list corrections; added XSG Shanghai; removed BMF Taipei
    S-meter extension:
        Don't clear graph on frequency change. Instead draw vertical division marker: red when
        frequency change, green when mode change.
    Better detection of missing audio panner API on some browsers.

v1.317  August 26, 2019
    Added to admin network tab a new switch:
        "Prevent multiple connections from the same IP address?"
        Defaults to NO. The check is bypassed for local net connections and those
        requiring a user password. And also for any admin connections.

v1.316  August 25, 2019
    Fix bug with ADC overflow averaging. First development extension parameter sets
        averaging mask (see Kiwi forum).

v1.315  August 24, 2019
    In Verilog FPGA code use a more correct method of moving register data between
        different clock domains (suggested by Christoph).
    Do averaging of ADC overflow signal prior to generating "OV" indicator on S-meter.

v1.314  August 20, 2019
    Improve browser audio initialization errors logged by server.

v1.313  August 18, 2019
    Fix time limit exemption password problem.

v1.312  August 17, 2019
    Added left-right panning slider to audio tab. Usefulness is limited by the fact that there is
    no audio synchronization between multiple channels on the same Kiwi. And especially not between
    different Kiwis. For example frequency/location diversity reception using two channels and
    L-R separation will be problematic depending on the signal type being received.

    Pan slider does not appear when using Safari or with any browser on iOS (i.e. iPhone, iPad).
    This is because Apple doesn't have the necessary audio support.
    Tested with desktop Firefox/Chrome and with Android 8.x

v1.311  August 16, 2019
    Added IP blacklist to admin network tab (uses Linux iptables).

v1.310  August 15, 2019
    Identify and disconnect bots which are not following the Kiwi connection API.
    
    Added wlan1 to eth0 and wlan0 as valid local network interfaces.
        Note that WiFi wlan interfaces do not work with the admin page DUC client and static/DHCP
        configuration on the network tab. Existing Debian/Linux WiFi tools must be used instead.

v1.309  July 20, 2019
    TDoA extension: revert back to latest map provider and TDoA user interface.

v1.307,308  July 19, 2019
    TDoA extension: revert to broken Google maps due to unavailability of current map provider.

v1.306  July 18, 2019
    Admin GPS tab improvements:
        Galileo sats in alert are removed from the channel after a few seconds.
        New priority mode for QZSS. It's been pointed out that because there are relatively
            few QZSS sats at present (4 currently) they can be unfairly "locked out" if many
            Navstar and Galileo sats are being received and taking all the channels.
            If the priority checkbox is set the last two free channels are reserved for QZSS sats.
            This number is reduced if sufficient QZSS sats already occupy a channel.
            For example if 3 QZSS sats have a channel only one is reserved to try and capture the 4th.

v1.305  July 17, 2019
    Admin GPS tab improvements:
        Disabling GPS acquisition of individual GNSS system clears associated channels.
        Changed options to checkboxes; better descriptions.

v1.303,304  July 16, 2019
    Added checkboxes to enable acquisition of individual GNSS systems.
    Added "Include Galileo?" switch on GPS tab of admin page.
    Fixed bug where change of "Include alerted?" switch didn't have immediate effect.

v1.302  July 15, 2019
    Added E1B alert flag processing to Galileo sats.

v1.300,301  July 10, 2019
    Update Debian archive keyring to eliminate clang package errors.

v1.299  July 9, 2019
    By special request (time-sensitive): option to automatically update WPSR reporter grid from GPS.
        See the WSPR section of the admin "extensions" tab. Useful for Kiwis in motion.

v1.297,298  July 6, 2019
    TDoA extension improvements:
        Changed to "pie wedge" animation during 30 second signal sampling.
        Checkboxes are displayed after sampling that can be used during a rerun to exclude stations.
            Useful when you've decided a station in the sampling list is giving poor results.
            Only applies to the rerun button and not the full submit button.
        Fixed various marker problems when switching between result and setup maps.

v1.296  July 5, 2019
    TDoA extension improvements:
        Help panel now explains URL parameters.
        Sampling and reference stations given in URL can be abbreviated.
            (e.g. "dcf" matches "DCF77", "cyp2" matches "OTHR/CYP2")
        Added "listen" icon (green speaker) to sampling station list.
            Previously you could double-click a sampling station marker on the map to open a
            connection in another window to check if that Kiwi is hearing the target signal.
            The listen icon does the same thing but from within the control panel.
        Added Cypress reference stations: alternative OTHR/CYP2 site, TWR/R.Sawa MWBC site.

v1.295  June 25, 2019
    Make audio work on SmartTV browser (developed on an LG WebOS UH652V TV)

v1.294  June 22, 2019
    Fix FSK extension shift/baud processing.

v1.293  June 21, 2019
    URL parameters added for the FSK extension. Help button panel added for FSK and IQ extensions.
    
    Last admin tab used is reselected on page load.
    
    Kiwi scanner (kiwisdr.com/scan) v1.5 allows port number to be specified.

v1.292  June 16, 2019
    Masked frequencies will not be applied when a valid time limit exemption password is given in
        the URL, e.g. mykiwi.com:8073/? ... &pwd=the_password (or &password=the_password)
        Connections from the local network (normally privileged) still see the effect of the
        masked frequencies.  This is so admins can setup and test masked labels from the main UI.
        The time limit exemption password is set on the control tab of the admin page.
        This is separate, and not to be confused with, the user password on the admin security tab
        which controls access to the sdr channels.
    
    Fixed a bunch of masked frequency related bugs including a problem when running in 20 kHz mode.

    If a Kiwi has time limits or masked frequencies configured an icon will be included in the
        status line appearing on sdr.hu and rx.kiwisdr.com (i.e. alongside the existing icons
        indicating 20 kHz mode, GPS enabled and the antenna switch extension available).
        An hour-glass icon if inactivity or 24 hour time limits are configured.
        A red, circle-slash "no entry" icon if masked frequencies are configured.
    
    Keep GPS az/el background image from flashing with latest versions of Firefox and Safari.
    
    Update TDoA help button panel to indicate current mode setting is ignored (IQ data is always used).
    
    Ran clang static analyzer over entire source code base. Found a few bugs.
        Also ran the clang address sanitizer for a while and fixed a few memory leaks.

v1.291  June 13, 2019
    Fix problems with the last release:
        Deleting masked frequency labels.
        Missing echoing of black dots in password fields.
        A single step of the mouse wheel didn't always zoom.
        Reduce unnecessary cases of "click to start" being displayed.

v1.290  June 12, 2019
    UI changes for devices with small screens: (phones or tablets)
        Clicking control panel navbar "Off" icon repeatedly will toggle the top bar visibilities.
            Similar to how 'y' shortcut key functions with desktop browsers.
        For narrow phone-width screens the control panel is scaled to fit the screen width
            if the phone is being held in "portrait" orientation when connecting to the Kiwi.
    
    Support for "masked" frequencies where the audio is muted and the waterfall blanked.
        Designed to help deter users who camp on particular frequencies for long periods of time.
        As admin create DX label(s) with a type value of "masked". When any part of the current
        passband crosses into the masked area the audio is muted. The mode of the label determines
        the width of the masked/blanked area (as seen on the waterfall). Custom label passbands apply
        so you can precisely control which frequencies are masked.
    
    S-meter extension now has selectable averaging. Previously, when the measurement speed
        speed was low, the multiple S-meter samples were plotted along the same x-axis position.
        Also, the speed slider now selects an inverse power of two samples (was linear).
        The maximum measurement interval (1/4096) is now roughly 1.5 minutes.
    
    Support for cloning Kiwi configuration files from another running Kiwi. See new user interface
        on the admin config tab. This is intended for owners of multiple Kiwis (yes they exist!)
        that want an easy way to replicate an existing configuration before further customization.
        All of the relevant files in /root/kiwi.config are cloned including kiwi.json, admin.json,
        dx.json and config.js (band definitions). Option to clone only the dx.json file.
        
    Better trackpad/mouse-wheel waterfall zoom behavior.
        Previously the trackpad response was too sensitive causing the zoom to go full max/min
        instantly for a small trackpad movement even though a mouse wheel worked reasonably.
    
    Proxy support for variable port number.
        Previously only one Kiwi could be proxied per public ip address.
        Now multiple Kiwis with different local port numbers can use the proxy service behind
        a router with a single public ip/global-port. The Kiwis are differentiated by their
        host names on the proxy. E.g. mykiwi1.proxy.kiwisdr.com:8073/ and
        mykiwi2.proxy.kiwisdr.com:8073/ (note both port 8073) where mykiwi1 could be on
        local network port 8073 and mykiwi2 on local port 8074.

v1.289  May 13, 2019
    Save/restore last squelch value set.
    
    SSTV extension:
        New modes now working: R24, R36, W2120, W2180, PD50, PD90
        Untested modes: M3, M4
        "auto adjust" checkbox and associated "undo adjust" / "auto adjust" button.
            Allows you to undo a faulty auto image adjust or disable entirely.
        Added help button info.
        Use URL containing e.g. "&ext=sstv,14" to select 14230 band menu entry.
            Other options "test", "noadj".

v1.288  May 11, 2019
    UI changes for devices with small screens: (phones or tablets)
        Control panel defaults to "Off" option tab making it smaller.
        Top bar (Kiwi information) is hidden but label area remains visible.
        Purple "readme" panel is always closed even on first-time site visit.

    SSTV extension:
        Robot modes R72 and R12BW working. R24, R36 and other B/W modes still need work.
        Band menu now has optimized passband for 1200-2300 Hz SSTV signal.
        Added reset button.

v1.287  May 9, 2019
    Fix problem preventing network update from factory-shipped v1.2
    SSTV code cleanup

v1.286  May 8, 2019
    Sig gen extension now requires admin password (local network exemption applies).

    SSTV extension:
        Fixed left-edge image offset after manual slant correction.
        Show mode of each received image.
        Added band select menu.

v1.285  May 6, 2019
    The "disable recent changes" switch is now on the update tab of the admin page.
    
    SSTV extension:
        Display reception SNR.
        Improved realtime behavior during times of low SNR.
            (was doing too much extra computation causing undesirable side-effects)
        Fixed a bunch of buffer overflow/leakage problems.
        
        Added manual slant/offset correction:
            Click two points in the image that correspond to where you think the left edge is located.
            Sometimes this appears in the image as a black vertical "sync stripe".
            
            The two points define a line whose angle is used to correct the slant of the image.
            The image left edge is also set to this line position after the slant is corrected.

            The clicked points do not have to be at the extreme top and bottom of the image.
            Click anywhere along the vertical axis to define the line. Only the accuracy of the
            angle and horizontal position is important.
            
            Limitations:
            Currently you can only adjust the most recently received image if multiple images
            are displayed (the image marked by the yellow triangle is the latest received)
            
            Bugs:
            The slant is properly corrected, but many times the left edge is not. Worse, the
            color planes become separated. This is being worked on.

v1.284  May 3, 2019
    Add admin config option to disable recent changes (e.g. Firefox audio fix)
    Alpha test of SSTV extension. Many known bugs. No UI features yet.

v1.283  April 28, 2019
    Workaround for Firefox problem: audio/WF stops when action taken that opens another window/tab
        (e.g. right-click menu database lookup selection)
    Move "OV" indicator to cover "dBm" text instead of numerical value on S-meter.

v1.282  April 14, 2019
    Change de-emphasis filter to a Biquad. Attenuation curve is much better (but still not perfect,
        especially for 12 kHz sample rates i.e. 4 and 8-channel modes).
    Fixed passband CF tooltip when downconverter offset used.

v1.281  April 12, 2019
    Add URL parameter "peak" to set spectrum peak hold mode (overrides last value saved in cookie)
        e.g. "&peak", or redundantly "&peak=1", but more usefully "&peak=0"

    Audio FFT:
        Allow URL parameter "no_wf" to be used in 4 and 3-channel modes, not just 8-channel mode.
            This is useful e.g. if you want to use the audio FFT to study the frequency response of
            the new de-emphasis filter in 20 kHz mode (3-channel mode) where you would otherwise
            never be given the audio FFT because there is no shortage of waterfall channels.
        Added missing window function to FFT.
        Fixed scale/waterfall click frequency in non-IQ modes.

    Added signal generator extension. When enabled replaces ADC input to audio/waterfall DDCs
        with a tunable RF signal source using the same FPGA DDS IP block used by the DDC mixers.

        WARNING: Be careful about drawing conclusions re Kiwi performance and possible bugs
        when using the sig gen. It reveals spurious responses in the waterfall/spectrum to a greater
        degree than if you just tune around with an antenna connected. But without detailed
        experimentation it can be difficult to know where the limitations are. Remember that the
        Kiwi is a carefully balanced compromise to get 4-channel mode to work (i.e. fit in the FPGA
        and have enough Beagle CPU cycles). So the DDSs, mixers, DDCs and FFTs are not perfect.
        Speaking of compromise, when considering FFTs it's important to understand this:
        en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_leakage

v1.280  April 8, 2019
    Spectrum improvements:
        Add peak hold function. When running toggle "Peak" button to clear and restart.
        Last spectrum filter, filter parameter and peak hold setting saved in browser cookie.

    Audio improvements:
        Added de-emphasis control on audio tab. Standard 50us NA and 75us EU attenuation profiles.
            AM/NBFM modes only. Attenuation curves may not be 100% correct. Needs measurement.
            Should help reproduce flat passbands transmitted by AM/NBFM stations using pre-emphasis.
            Will also help with listening fatigue caused by excessive high-frequency gain.
        Fixed bug that caused distortion in 3 channel mode when audio bandwith at 20.25 kHz maximum.

v1.279  April 7, 2019
    Added to WF tab:
        Selectable spectrum filters, IIR, MMA, EMA with parameter slider.
        Corresponding URL parameters e.g. &sp=ema&spp=16 &sp=iir&spp=0.5
        "GND" momentary button that zeros (grounds) the waterfall/spectrum input data
            so you can see how the various spectrum filter setups decay.

v1.278  April 1, 2019
    Denoiser/autonotch checkboxes in audio tab now correctly load LMS_filter extension code.

v1.276, 277  March 29, 2019
    Clicking on frequency link icon (lime-colored, NE-pointing arrow near frequency entry box)
        now copies URL to clipboard directly. Hover on icon to see generated URL.

    Fixed built-in recording function for IQ mode (recording using other modes was fine).
        Left channel was full-scale noise and playback sample rate wrong due to incorrect
        sample size being set in file. Can't believe no one complained about this before.
        But some playback software may have compensated for this issue automatically.

    Fixed problem with IQ mode AGC distortion found by DazDSP. This may improve DRM reception.

v1.275  March 20, 2019
    Improvements to FSK extension
        Added menu presets for Ham band RTTY calling frequencies.
        Added a preliminary help button panel.
        In framing mode changing the bits/word value immediately redraws using the current sample
            instead of requiring a new sample to be taken. This makes it easier to work with
            FSK transmissions that are intermittent in nature.

v1.274  March 17, 2019
    Added URL parameter "keys=" to apply specified keyboard shortcut keys upon connection.
        Example: "keys=xyyys" would cause the control panel to be hidden ('x' key),
        top and label bars to be hidden ('yyy' keys) and spectrum display to appear ('s' key).
        The shift key can obviously be used (e.g. capital 'S' for waterfall auto-scale) but the
        control and option keys cannot. But this should not be a significant limitation as it only
        effects parameters which can be set in other ways (see below).

        The keys used to enter values and options into the frequency box cannot be entered using
        this new parameter. Use the existing "f=" URL parameter instead. Remember that you can
        directly set the zoom value using the f= parameter since the other components are optional
        e.g. f=usbz7 f=/750cwz12 f=z4
        
    Added URL parameter "wfm=min{,max}" to directly set waterfall colormap control values.
        Example: wfm=-90 (WF max value is unchanged) wfm=-120,-60 (changes both values)

v1.273  March 15, 2019
    URL parameter "abuf=min" for specifying the minimum length of the audio output buffer (in secs)
        can now optionally take the form "abuf=min,max" e.g. "abuf=0.6,1.2" for 0.6 to 1.2 seconds
        worth of buffering. With only min specified the default max is min * 3 which may be
        too much in some cases.

v1.272  March 14, 2019
    Added URL parameters "p", "prot" and "protected" (they are all equivalent) to force a
        password protected channel to be used when connecting. This is for the case of a Kiwi with
        a mix of password protected channels and publicly available channels without a password. 
        And you want to connect without decreasing the pool of public channels.
        
        Note that if you are connecting from the same local network as the Kiwi, and admin auto-login
        has been setup, this is counted as a connection from the password protected pool and you
        do not need to specify this parameter. So you would not need to specify the "prot"
        parameter for a Kiwi on your local network but you would need it for a Kiwi installed at
        a remote location. Or it would be needed by a group of users to access the private channel(s)
        without impacting the availability of the public pool.

v1.270, 271  March 5, 2019
    Step to next/previous DX label (filtered or not) using the following:
        Shift-and-alt/option j, i, or left/right arrow keys (i.e. hold both shift and alt/option)
            (shift-key alone and alt/option-key alone of these keys speedup the frequency step
            function these keys normally perform. See the keyboard shortcut help menu)
        Shift-click on control panel pan buttons (circled "<" and ">" icons)
    When label stepping the current mode and custom passband (if any) is set
    
    Automatically close filter panel when both fields are set empty.
    
    Fixed a bug where if filtering was in effect, and you edited a label, the results of the
        editing would not appear in the filtered results immediately.

v1.269  March 3, 2019
    Added DX label filtering. Type '@' keyboard shortcut or use entry in right click menu.

v1.267, 268  March 1, 2019
    In user tab on control panel show time remaining for both the inactivity timeout and connect
        time per ip address per 24 hours. Inactivity limit suffixed with "act" and resets when
        frequency, mode or zoom changed. Per-ip limit suffixed with "24h". Lesser of the two
        values is shown.
    The time limit exemption password can now be given in the URL, e.g. mykiwi:8073/?pwd=xyz
        Or use 'password=' in place of 'pwd='

v1.266  February 26, 2019
    Fixes for IQ balance function in IQ extension:
        Improved the user interface.
            Now warns to turn PLL mode OFF.
            Added "reset to default values" button.
            Show previous total IQ offset in addition to pending IQ offset adjustment.
        Discovered that 20 kHz mode (aka 3-channel mode) requires a different default IQ
            offset from 12 kHz (4/8-channel) mode.
        Added manual IQ offset adjustment to admin config tab. 

v1.265  February 18, 2019
    AM mode passband changed from 10 kHz to 9.8 kHz to avoid adjacent channel heterodynes in
        shortwave broadcast bands (by request).
    Show error pattern in LEDs if ip address was never assigned by DHCP or self-assignment.

v1.264  February 8, 2019
    Fixed a few buffer smashes.
    Got admin console control keys working again due to browser API changes (i.e. ^C ^D ^\)
    Better support for compiling and debugging with the LLVM/Clang address sanitizer (replaces valgrind)
    Log ipinfo and timezone servers used.

v1.263  February 5, 2019
    Fixed a problem with FAX extension. File saves show you results from the first save repeatedly
    (i.e. on subsequent saves) due to interactions with the browser cache.

v1.262  January 28, 2019
    Fixed audio CIC passband flatness (thanks Christoph).
    admin UI improvements: sdr.hu location and network auto-NAT fields.
    FSK crosshairs now follow waterfall panning.
    A few corrections to extension help button info.

v1.261  January 15, 2019
    Improved compatibility with recent Android versions.
        E.g. now working with Android 8.1.0, "Go" version.

v1.259, 260  January 12, 2019
    Added debugging for lock priority inversion problem.

v1.257, 258  January 9, 2019
    TDoA UI improvements:
        Added "4" button to zoom buttons at upper left. Zooms directly to level 4.
        Shift-clicking on the +/- buttons zooms by 3 levels instead of just one.
        Added distance scale (in km/m & miles/feet) to map at lower right.
        Added ruler function. Click on the "protractor" icon at lower right. Mouse cursor will
            change to cross symbol. Click on starting map position. Move mouse to ending map
            position and double-click to end ruler measurement. Or single-click to make
            intermediate measurement and continue. Click on icon to clear measurement.
            Don't use escape key as that will close the extension! (this may be fixed in the future)
    
    Admin GPS tab: now says "loading maps..." when display delayed due to map download process.

    By request: URL parameter "no_geo" to disable browser from determining and sending Kiwi the
        geolocation information of the connecting user.
        Use like other URL parameters, e.g. "mykiwi:8073/?f=5Mam&mute&no_geo"
        This will someday become one of the "user preferences" options.

v1.256  January 8, 2019
    TDoA
        Fixed bug introduced in v1.255 causing some TDoA solutions to fail.
        UI improvements:
            Mousing over markers makes them highlight in yellow.
            Marker overlap. When markers (Kiwis and reference stations) are located within 2 km
            of each other the selected marker(s) are separated by a small amount. This amount
            matters less in terms of location accuracy as the zoom level is increased.
            So it's a compromise between less overlap and marker accuracy.

v1.255  January 7, 2019
    TDoA improvements:
        20 and 12 kHz Kiwis can now be used together in computing TDoA solutions.
        Old TDoA algorithm is deprecated and no longer available from user interface.
        New "spiderfy" user interface for marker clusters:
            When the mouse moves over a marker cluster (circle with number representing the number
            of contained host or reference markers) a popup list used to be displayed.
            But this popup list was static and you couldn't selected an entry by clicking on it.
            Now a "spiderfied" view of the cluster is presented where the contents of the cluster
            pop-out and are linked back to the center of the cluster with white lines.
            While popped-out you can click on the host or reference marker to select it.

            To remove the spider mouse over another cluster or click on the map (outside a cluster).

            To revert to the old user interface start the TDoA extension from the URL specifying
            the "prev_ui:" parameter e.g. "mykiwi:8073/?ext=tdoa,prev_ui:" (note ending ":")
            
            There is still a problem of markers sometimes overlapping each other when selected as
            sampling stations or as the reference station.

v1.254  January 6, 2019
    TDoA: fixed spurious "no recent GPS timestamps" error after sampling.
    Better admin network DHCP/static-ip selection checking.
    Admin login: display a different message and client ip when no admin password set.
        Done as an aid in debugging the issue where people say they're getting a password prompt
        on new out-of-the-box Kiwis when a local network login should work.

v1.252, 253  January 4, 2019
    TDoA timing normalization for 20 kHz mode.

v1.251  January 1, 2019
    Add icon and "20 kHz" to sdr.hu status for Kiwis in new wide bandwidth mode.
    
    MSK100/200 mode for the iq display from Christoph. Useful for looking at VLF MSK signals
        when the Kiwi doesn't have GPS clock correction. Try MSK200 mode on these (and others)
        EU: DHO38, HWU(20.9), TFK(ISL), NSY, FUG(62.6), JXN?(NOR)
        NA: NAA, NLK, NLM4, NAU(PR)
        PAC: NWC(AUS), NPM(HI), NDT/NDI?(JPN), VTX?(IND)
        Use demod settings: AM mode, passband 50-100 Hz
        IQ extension settings: gain = auto-scale, density, mode = IQ, MSK200, pll_bw <= 5

v1.250  December 31, 2018
    Add 20 kHz wide audio bandwidth mode.
        A third entry to the list of FPGA configurations. See admin "mode" tab for details.
    
    Add Ethernet 10/100 speed select to admin network tab.
        The speed changes after a few seconds of delay (no Kiwi restart required).
        This allows you to be looking at a waterfall in another window and see if
        the Ethernet spurs (if present at your installation) improve or not.
        Be sure the device (router, switch) your Kiwi connects to supports 10 Mbps Ethernet.
    
    Accept 'k' & 'M' scaling suffixes in frequency and passband parameters.
        Examples: Type "/15k" in frequency box to get a 15 kHz wide passband. Or "/2.7k", "-5k,10k" etc.
        Use a URL of "...?f=7.4M/16.5k" to set a frequency of 7.4 MHz and passband of 16.5 kHz.
        Note uppercase 'M' since 'm' is already keyboard shortcut for mute.
        You can remember this because the 'M' in MHz is always capitalized whereas 'k' in kHz is not.
        Note also 'k' used to be paired with 'j' as the frequency up/down jog shortcut.
        Now the 'j' and 'i' keys are used (also 'J' and 'I' to jog faster).
        Using the 'i' key is actually more natural because it fits the placement of your
        index and middle fingers better than 'j' and 'k'.
        Finally, 'i' was previously used to select IQ mode. Now use 'q' instead.
        Type 'h' or '?' to see the complete keyboard shortcut help panel.

v1.249  December 11, 2018
    If applicable show remaining time of 24hr time limit in user lists
        (in orange text on both user tab and status tab of admin page).

v1.248  December 10, 2018
    Fix race condition in 24hr time limit code. Charge time from multiple connections.

v1.247  December 7, 2018
    Prevent bad sdr.hu configuration.

v1.246  December 6, 2018
    Added Christoph's GNSS Kalman filter. Spectacular improvement in position solutions.
        Accuracy is improved and outliers are removed (on the admin GPS tab the "solution"
        status indicator "S" will no longer flash red indicating a bad solution).
        Most importantly the filter allows solutions to be computed when there are fewer
        than 4 satellites being received (the usual requirement for an MLAT solution).
        This will significantly improve the amount of time a Kiwi is eligible for TDoA use.
        See Christoph's blog post for more details:
        hcab14.blogspot.com/2018/09/kiwisdr-gnss-position-solutions-using.html
    
    Brightness control of the 4 blue status LEDs added (see new menu in admin config tab).

v1.245  November 1, 2018
    Show message when extension is dynamically loading.
 
v1.243,244  October 25, 2018
    Security improvements.
 
v1.242  October 24, 2018
    Remove CIC compensation because it causes WSPR distortion.
 
v1.241  October 21, 2018
    Revert changes since v1.240 causing occasional audio pauses and/or static bursts.
 
v1.240  October 19, 2018
    Dynamically load extension code (Javascript & CSS).
        Part of changes to improve initial page load time.
    Admin GPS map: use new map provider.
    TDoA: add graticule overlay. Has bug of not always being visible.
    Reduction in disconnects when > 6 channels connected and non-Kiwi Linux tasks running.
        This is an improvement, but the problem is not completely solved.
 
v1.239  October 14, 2018
    User interface improvements:
        'x' and 'y' shortcut keys toggle control panel, top bar visibility respectively.
 
v1.238  October 7, 2018
    TDoA extension:
        Changed mapping provider. BETA TEST. There are known problems, but it is better
        than the currently broken Google map. Use "gmap:" in URL to use old Google maps,
        e.g. "?ext=tdoa,gmap:"
 
v1.237  October 2, 2018
    Fix bug causing server crash-loop on update if WSPR auto-run enabled.
 
v1.236  October 1, 2018
    Changed timezone lookup providers.
 
v1.235  September 30, 2018
    Christoph's fixes for clean web socket connection closing.
 
v1.234  September 29, 2018
    Increase receiver DDC channel NCO phase word width from 32 to 48 bits.
        This stops all rotation of (ground wave) LF/VLF signals on the IQ extension display
        caused by increased quantization of NCO phase for low receive frequencies when
        a phase word of only 32-bits is used.

v1.233  September 28, 2018
    Fixed precision bug in mixer NCO value computation.

v1.232  September 25, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        New checkbox to select Christoph's improved TDoA algorithm. Original algorithm still available.
            To select in URL use "new:" e.g. "... &ext=tdoa, ... ,new:,submit:"

v1.231  September 22, 2018
    Add "click to start" overlay now that Safari 12 implements auto-play restrictions.

v1.230  September 19, 2018
    CW decoder: add filter output graph with threshold indicator.
    Fix Google timezone lookups.

v1.229  September 18, 2018
    CW decoder extension improvements:
        Require 4 decoding errors before re-train. (previously just 1)
        Added error count indicator.
        Specifying extension argument fixes decoder filter frequency and disables passband tracking.
            e.g. my_kiwi:8073/?ext=cw,500
    In addition to specifying passband "/pbw" and "/lo,hi" in URL and frequency entry box
        can now also specify ":pbc" and ":pbc,pbw" to easily change passband center.
    Added event notification API for the benefit of CATSync.

v1.226,227,228  September 17, 2018
    CW decoder extension improvements:
        Realtime fixes.
        Added checkbox for "word space correction".
            Change when spacing between words is consistently wrong.
        Added checkbox for "threshold correction".
            Checking seems to help with weak signal decoding.
        Added a button which resets the code.
        Added a "train" indicator that lights when code speed training is active.

v1.225  September 16, 2018
    CW decoder extension fixes.

v1.224  September 15, 2018
    Added CW decoder extension.

v1.223  September 12, 2018
    CIC filter compensation via empirical measurement.
    Minor TDoA UI improvements.

v1.222  September 11, 2018
    Re-enabled the AM post-detector FIR filter after fixing the underlying problem as the
        FIR filter is needed to workaround the known issue with CIC filter droop.
    TDoA extension improvements:
        "rerun" button: reruns the TDoA calculation using the existing samples.
            Useful when you just want to adjust the map position/zoom or remove a
            station's samples from the list and then recalculate.
        If any of the TDoA result maps are selected when the submit or rerun buttons
            are pressed then the position/zoom of the result map is used for the new run.
            Previously only the Kiwi map position/zoom was ever used.
            

v1.220,221  September 9, 2018
    Added audio FFT in the waterfall/spectrum for those channels where the regular
        multi-level zoom waterfall/spectrum is not available.

v1.219  August 30, 2018
    Christoph's fix for web socket close.
    Update Galileo sat list.
    Admin control tab option to disable all waterfall/spectrum display.
        By request. This option saves Internet bandwidth.
        Doesn't include audio FFT waterfall which consumes no additional Internet bandwidth.

v1.218  August 20, 2018
    Solution for the GPS "diminishing fixes" problem.

    New admin config parameters to set external ADC clock frequency and GPS correction.
    Other ADC clock control improvements in IQ extension and "cal ADC clock" menu item.
    Fix race causing incorrect inactivity timeouts under certain circumstances.
    Passband can be specified in the "f=" URL parameter, format same as frequency entry box.
        See: kiwisdr.com/info#id-user-tune
        This is an alternative to specifying the passband alone with "pbw=" or "pb=" parameters.

v1.214  August 1, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        Fix for TDoA with a mix of RX4 and RX8 mode Kiwis (GPS timestamp offset).
        Get reference station list from kiwisdr.com instead of hardwired in code.
        Keep selected Kiwi and reference markers out of marker clusters.

        Updated help info.

v1.209  July 22, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        When TDoA complete automatically switch to result map.
        Switch option bar to 'off' (and restore) when TDoA running. Obscures the map less.
        Option checkboxes moved to right of map display.
        Added checkboxes to show/hide reference stations and day/night overlay.
        Added more references stations.
    Fix passband width adjustment when passband is offset from carrier (i.e. ssb, cw)
    Use pointer cursor for menus and checkboxes.

v1.208  July 21, 2018
    Commas in frequency entry field work again (broken since keyboard shortcuts added).
    Can now quickly change passband via entry in frequency entry field:
        Type "freq/pbw" or just "/pbw" where pbw is the passband width in Hz
        or the low and high edges with "low,high".
        Examples:
        1234.56             set f=1234.56 as usual
        1234,56             set f=1234.56 using comma as decimal separator
        234.56/1200         set f=234.56 and pbw=1200 around current pb center
        /600                set pbw=600
        /300,3000           set pb=(300,3000) i.e. usb 2700 Hz wide
        7255/-2600,-300     set f=7255 and pbw=(-2600,-300) i.e. lsb 2300 Hz wide
    Facility added to load certain javascript asynchronously (e.g. Google maps).
    
    TDoA extension improvements:
        New URL parameter "submit:" that will automatically start TDoA on webpage load.
            e.g. ...?ext=tdoa,submit:,F1JEK,DL6ECS,SWL/JO21JN,DCF77
            There is a 6 second delay for the initial status inquiries to complete.
        6 character grid square used for ID instead of old "KiwiNNN" (Thanks Martin).
        Duplicate IDs distinguished by appending /N to the ID (N = 2,3,...)
        Multiple Kiwis at identical locations on map dithered slightly so all are visible.
        More reliable communications protocol with server should prevent hangs.
        Submit button changes to a stop button while TDoA running (feature may still have bugs).
        "Most likely position" marker now shown on result maps.
            This in addition to reference position if one has been specified.
        Most likely position lat/lon shown at panel top along with cyan Google map link.
            Triple-click on lat/lon value to copy/paste.
        Green link icon at panel top has URL with current TDoA extension configuration
            Right-click while hovered on link to create configuration bookmark or
            click to open in a new tab/window (less useful).
            Link is continuously updated as map is changed, host list changed etc.
        After sampling each host shows a download icon for the recorded .wav IQ file.

v1.207  July 17, 2018
    TDoA extension improvements:
        Allow extension parameters in URL, e.g.
            ...?ext=tdoa,lat:49,lon:7.5,z:6,F1JEK,DL6ECS,DCF77
            Will zoom the map to specified lat/lon/zoom and select specified Kiwis and ref station.
            lat/lon/zoom is displayed at control panel upper right for reference.
        Cluster markers when they are too close together:
            Hover mouse over cluster for list of markers it contains.
            A cluster single-click zooms +1.
            A cluster double-click zooms in to reveal all the markers.
        Show Kiwi markers on new maps (just like they are shown on old maps).
        Second double-click of reference marker goes back to last map position/zoom.
        Kiwi map type selected is carried to result map type.
        Added additional reference stations:
            WWV/B, NMC, KPH, JJY/40/60, NDT/JJI, NDI, JXN, VTX3/4, DCF49/HGA22/DCF39, DDH47

    Added TDoA-service extension. Under development.
    Fixed bug that reduced the frequency of GPS solutions under certain conditions.
    Include GPS good/fix counts in /status URL query.
    Add URL args to redirect URL, e.g. a connection to mykiwi:8073/?f=5000 will redirect to
        mykiwi:8074/?f=5000 if mykiwi:8074 is the configured redirect URL (thanks PK).
    Support Ethernet / WiFi virtual interfaces, e.g. eth0:1
        Some people use this to implement dual IPv4/IPv6 local networks.
    Major w3_util API cleanup including update from W3.css v2.65 to v3.4
    Disable keyboard shortcuts for Firefox <= v52, Chrome <= v49 and Opera <= v36 due to
        browser compatibility problems.
    Use a build directory outside the source tree so that source files can be shared between

    Added external ADC clock selection switch to config tab of admin page.
    Switch to using three new geolocation servers.

v1.190,191  May 10, 2018
    Added keyboard shortcuts. Press "h" or "?" to toggle a help list. Work in progress.
    IQ display extension now supports mPSK (BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK) carrier locking.
        See the Kiwi forum for more details.
    DX edit panel:
        1) New "extension" field. Place name of extension and associated parameters in this field
        and the extension will be started when dx label is clicked. Label turns magenta instead of
        yellow when you mouse over the label and an extension has been specified.
        Use ctrl/alt-click to skip starting extension and only select frequency as usual.
        Extension specification is the same as used in the URL "ext=" parameter. See documentation.
        2) New "passband" field. Format is a single number in Hz specifying the width of a
        symmetrical passband around the carrier (i.e. AM or DSB) or two numbers separated by a
        comma or space specifying the low and high passband offsets (e.g. "300, 700" for USB-CW)
    With the above two features you can create a dx label for a STANAG 4285 signal that specifies
        the proper 2400 Hz AM bandwidth (+/- 1200 around carrier) and then a label extension field
        of "iq,density,8PSK".
    FAX extension aligns entire image when shift-click is used.
        Also touch alignment now works on mobile devices.
    Escape key now closes extension and confirmation panels in all cases.

    Fix to eliminate audio glitches when a large dx list is edited/updated from the web interface.

v1.176,177,178  Apr 18, 2018
    The Kiwi GPS now receives Galileo satellites in addition to Navstar and QZSS.
        A GPS antenna with restricted sky visibility will now have more satellites to choose from
        and should produce position/time solutions more often.
        Please consider attaching the GPS antenna to your Kiwi, especially if yours is a
        public Kiwi listed on sdr.hu  This will assist with ongoing HF direction finding experiments
        as well as serve as a source of frequency calibration for your Kiwi.
        Thanks to Christoph Mayer for important insight and bug fixes.
    Admin GPS tab now has Google map display.

            Combined with the shadow map this will indicate if QZS-3 is likely to be received.

v1.170  Feb 8, 2018
    Added GPS support for Japan's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS).
        Should have reception over entire Asia-Oceania region (heard fine in New Zealand).

        Added numeric dBm value to S-meter.
        Added classic LMS denoiser and autonotch to audio tab. Filter controls on extension panel.
            The LMS filters are not a panacea for all filtering problems.
            They are tricky to adjust and don't work in all situations.
            The presets are a work-in-progress.
        Added audio mute icon/button to right of spectrum button (renamed "Spec" to fit).
        WF option tab
            Number after "WF" on option tab button is current zoom level, e.g. "WF10"
            "Auto Scale" button: automatically sets WF min/max.
                Best when there are a range of signal levels.
            "Slow Dev" button: Use when you have audio drops on slow mobile devices (e.g. old iPad).
                Uses single color in spectrum and slower waterfall speed.
            "colormap" & "contrast" menus: beginnings of waterfall colormap control. Work-in-progress.
            "spec filter" menu: variable spectrum time constant so decay time can be varied.
        Add URL parameter to set initial waterfall speed:
            wf={0, off, 1, 1hz, s, slow, m, med, f, fast} e.g. kiwi:8073/?wf=1hz
        Fixed problem with NDB database lookup not working.
