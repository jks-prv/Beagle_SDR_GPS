This fork by VE3SUN adds an IBP button to the web UI to track IBP beacons through their frequency change cycle.

KiwiSDR
=======

Software-defined Radio (SDR) and GPS for the BeagleBone Black
----------------------------------------------------------------------

An add-on board ("cape") that turns your Beagle into a web-accessible shortwave receiver.

Note: the KiwiSDR PCB design has moved to a separate repository called [KiwiSDR_PCB](https://github.com/jks-prv/KiwiSDR_PCB/).

### Kickstarter
KiwiSDR had a successful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1575992013/kiwisdr-beaglebone-software-defined-radio-sdr-with/).

### Details

* Listen live: [New Zealand](http://kiwisdr.com:8073), [Canada](http://kiwisdr.ece.uvic.ca:8073), [Sweden](http://kiwisdr.sk3w.se:8073), all others on [SDR.hu](http://sdr.hu/?top=kiwi)

### Description
This SDR is a bit different. It has a web interface that can be used by up to four separate listeners. Each one listening and tuning an independent frequency simultaneously. See the screenshots below.

### Components
* SDR covering the 10 kHz to 30 MHz (VLF-HF) spectrum.
* Web interface based on [OpenWebRX](http://openwebrx.org/) from András Retzler, HA7ILM.
* Integrated software-defined GPS receiver from Andrew Holme's [Homemade GPS Receiver](http://www.aholme.co.uk/GPS/Main.htm).
* LTC 14-bit 65 MHz ADC.
* Xilinx Artix-7 A35 FPGA.
* Skyworks SE4150L GPS front-end.

### Features
* 100% Open Source / Open Hardware.
* Includes VLF-HF active antenna and associated power injector PCBs.
* Browser-based interface allowing multiple simultaneous user web connections (currently 4).
* Each connection tunes an independent receiver channel over the entire spectrum.
* Waterfall tunes independently of audio and includes zooming and panning.
* Multi-channel, parallel DDC design using bit-width optimized CIC filters.
* Good performance at VLF/LF since I personally spend time monitoring those frequencies.
* Automatic frequency calibration via received GPS timing.
* Easy hardware and software setup. Browser-based configuration interface.

### Status

Give the live receivers a try at the links above. You'll need a recent version of a modern web browser that supports HTML5. The web interface works, with some problems, on iPad. But there is no mobile version of the interface yet.

The files of a KiCAD PCB layout of the cape are available. This PCB has been fabricated in production quantities
and shipped to over 350 customers.
Please email us any comments you have after reviewing the design document above. The active antenna and injector PCBs have been fabricated and are undergoing development.

### Objectives

We wanted to design an SDR that provides certain features, at a low price point, that we felt weren't covered by current devices. The SDR must be web-accessible and simple to setup and use.
We also wanted to provide a self-contained platform for experimentation with SDR and GPS techniques. 

Most importantly, We'd really like to see a significant number of web-enabled, wide-band SDRs deployed in diverse locations world-wide because that makes possible some really interesting applications and experiments.

### Operation

Users can purchase just the KiwiSDR board or a complete "kit" consisting of the board, BeagleBone Green (software pre-installed), enclosure (assembly required), and GPS antenna (see [here](http://www.kiwisdr.com/)).
The software will try to automatically open up an incoming port through whatever Internet firewall/router may exist on the local network, but the user may have to perform this step manually. An antenna solution must be provided. An adequate power supply to the Beagle (e.g. 5V @ 2A) will also be required.

Four channels of audio and waterfall streamed over the Internet 24/7 requires about 30 GB per month. This is a common cap for many residential broadband plans. An automatic dynamic-DNS system is already part of the software so a web link to the SDR is immediately available with no configuration. Of course the system can be configured to only allow connections from the local network and ignore Internet connection requests.
