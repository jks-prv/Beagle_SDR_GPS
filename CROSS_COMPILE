Instructions for cross-compiling KiwiSDR code on a fast development machine.
[updated 25 July 2022]

It is now possible to create an ARM architecture executable kiwi.bin file that can be
directly copied to Debian running on the Beagle of the Kiwi. It is essentially the same as
the executable created if the code is traditionally compiled on the Beagle. Except that
the compilation time is greatly reduced using the (presumably fast) development machine
compared to the Beagle. This is especially important given the slow compilation speed of
the new DRM code.


How it works:

Recall that on both the Beagle and the development machine all Kiwi source code is
contained in a directory called Beagle_SDR_GPS. And that all derived files from the build
(e.g. object files, the final kiwi.bin executable, other generated files) are stored in
the directory ../build relative to Beagle_SDR_GPS. Thus the source files and compiled
binaries are strictly separated. This is for the benefit of the auto update mechanism
which uses git which needs to not be confused by the presence of object files in the
Beagle_SDR_GPS directory.

The current Kiwi development cycle is to edit and test compile the sources on a
development machine. Then, after any compilation problems are resolved, to transfer (or
share via a file sharing mechanism) the sources with the Kiwi Beagle. And then recompile
on the Kiwi where binaries for the ARM architecture are created. After an initial complete
compile of all source files incremental compiles can be done when only a small subset of
the source files have changed. This helps to reduce compile times.

Also note that sources on the development machine should always be from a copy or clone
of the KiwiSDR project sources on GitHub: https://github.com/jks-prv/Beagle_SDR_GPS
rather than trying to copy them from the Kiwi Beagle.

With the cross-compile option it is now possible to create the ARM architecture object
files directly on the development machine and thus skip compilation on the Beagle entirely
(minus some additional work during a necessary "make install" run on the Beagle). At this
point all that is necessary is to copy the object files (and optionally the source files)
to the Beagle.

Important: In addition to the final kiwi.bin executable file all the intermediate object
files (e.g. ../build/obj*/*.o) are also copied to the Beagle during the "make install_xc"
command. Because of this is it possible to continue doing non cross-compiled incremental
development on the Beagle at this point because all the object files will be present.
The only difference is that they have been generated and copied from the development
machine as opposed to being compiled on the Beagle.

Since the object files are being copied it may also make sense to copy all the source
files from the Beagle_SDR_GPS tree as well. This can be accomplished by setting the
environment variable KIWI_XC_COPY_SOURCES to "true". This variable is checked when the
"make install_xc" is done. If you are already sharing source files via a file sharing
mechanism (e.g. sshfs, nfs) this copying would not be needed.

Cross compilation requires that the Beagle root filesystem be made available to the
development machine via a file sharing mechanism (e.g. sshfs, nfs). The development
machine mount point is assumed to be ${HOME}/mnt unless you specify it to be elsewhere
by setting KIWI_XC_REMOTE_FS.

To use sshfs use a command on the development machine similar to:
    sudo sshfs -o ro,follow_symlinks,auto_cache,reconnect root@kiwisdr:/ ${HOME}/mnt

To use nfs follow this procedure:
    On the Beagle first install the nfs server via the commands
    "pki nfs-common" and "pki nfs-kernel-server".
    Then edit the /etc/exports file and add "/ 192.168.1.0/24(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)"
    adjusting the subnet as necessary. Try "ps ax | grep nfs" and see if there are any
    processes named "nfsd" or beginning with "rpc". If not try rebooting.
    
    Then on the development machine try:
    sudo mount -t nfs -o ro,resvport kiwisdr:/ ${HOME}/mnt
    "resvport" is required for MacOS otherwise you get "operation not permitted" errors.
    
If the Beagle file sharing is working you should see a file called ${HOME}/mnt/ID.txt
On the Beagle an alias called "nfs" will show which ip addresses have mounted filesystems
from the Beagle.

If you have changed the host name of your Kiwi to anything other than the default
"kiwisdr", e.g. by editing the /etc/hostname file, then use that name in the commands
given here and set the environment variable KIWI_XC_HOST so the Makefile copies to the
correct host when "make install_xc" is used.


Setup instructions:

1. Follow setup instructions below for your specific development machine (e.g. Linux or MacOS).

2. Set environment variables described below if default values are not suitable.

3. Run these commands on development machine:
    make clean_dist     // removes all previous binary files that would otherwise conflict
    make xc             // make in cross-compile mode (xc)
    make install_xc     // copies kiwi.bin and *.o files to Kiwi build directory
                        // optionally copies source files as well (if KIWI_XC_COPY_SOURCES = true)
    
4. Now test and deploy by entering these commands on the Kiwi:
    Test on Kiwi by doing:
        cdp     // change to project directory ~root/Beagle_SDR_GPS
        mst     // optional: stop normal Kiwi server from running
        ./d     // run newly installed server in debug mode
                // (use "./k" for non-debug mode which includes enabling GPS)

    Deploy on Kiwi by doing:
        ^C      // stop the above if running
        cdp
        m       // alias for "make" (NB: NOT "make xc")
        mi      // alias for "make install" (NB: NOT "make install_xc").
        ku      // "kiwi up" starts new server in background mode


Environment variables:
(if not set the indicated defaults will be used)

KIWI_XC_HOST
Set to the host name or ip address of the Kiwi where the binary files will be copied.
Copying is done using rsync, i.e. "rsync .../*.o root@$(KIWI_XC_HOST):~root/build/..."
Defaults to "kiwisdr".

KIWI_XC_HOST_PORT
If for some reason rsync to the Kiwi requires a port number other than 22 (ssh) then
it can be specified here. This is unlikely when the target Kiwi is simply on your own
local network. In our case it occurs when the target Kiwi is at a remote customer site
where ssh connections from the Internet are on a non-standard port number for security
reasons. Defaults to port 22.

KIWI_XC_COPY_SOURCES
Set to "true" if you want the Kiwi source files copied along with the binaries to the
Beagle when a "make install_xc" is done. If not set the source files will not be copied.

KIWI_XC_REMOTE_FS
Set to a mount point (a directory) on the development machine where the Beagle root
directory will be mounted by your chosen file sharing mechanism (e.g. sshfs, nfs).
Defaults to "${HOME}/mnt"

KIWI_XC_LD
Set to the location of a Clang/LLVM loader capable of cross-compilation if the loader
of your Clang/LLVM tools doesn't work by default. E.g. this is the case with MacOS.
Defaults to "lld".


Setup instructions for specific development machines:

==== Ubuntu (example of a generic Linux setup)

Installing Clang-9, or another version, using a package mechanism is all that is needed.
The cross compile capability in Linux Clang seems to work fine for generating ARM binaries.
The Kiwi Makefile is already setup to use Clang when "make xc" is run.

==== MacOS Catalina (10.15)

The linker that is part of Xcode Clang/LLVM doesn't seem to work with cross compilation.
Follow the steps below to install an alternative linker which does work.

NB: We initially tried to get this working with MacOS Mojave 10.11 since that's what our
laptop was running. Brew warned about trying to install LLVM using such an old MacOS
release and the resulting linker didn't work for cross compiling. So we had to update
to Catalina.
 
1. If necessary update Xcode to the latest version (11.5) so that the Clang/LLVM compiler
tools are current.

2. Install the Brew 3rd-party package management system if not already present.
The MacPorts package system would also probably work.

3. After initial installation of the cross-compile environment, if you get an
error message at Kiwi link time that the correct version of libffi cannot be found in
/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib (e.g. libffi.7.dylib exists in that directory but LLVM is looking
for version 6) then LLVM needs to be upgraded to a version that will look for libffi version 7.
It is not known why libffi updates without a better error message indicating LLVM is
now out-of-date.

Using Brew install the latest LLVM (llvm@14 as of July 2022). This does not conflict with the
Xcode-installed Clang/LLVM because that is placed in the separate /usr/local/opt/llvm directory
(symlink to /usr/local/Cellar/llvm/...) Use the commands "brew update" followed by "brew upgrade"
to upgrade all Brew components including LLVM and libffi.

4. Set the environment variable KIWI_XC_LD in your .cshrc (or equivalent) to
"/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/ld.lld" to reference the linker from LLVM
which works with cross compilation. References to $(KIWI_XC_LD) are made in the
Kiwi Makefile.comp.inc file.

5. Cross compilation will need access to files from the root filesystem of the Kiwi.

We found that using sshfs on MacOS for this purpose has an interesting problem.
The mount appears to work but then the local mount point directory disappears from the
filesystem. It reappears when an unmount occurs. Example:
"sudo sshfs -o ro,follow_symlinks,auto_cache,reconnect root@kiwisdr:/ /Users/jks/mnt"
does not give an error. And the correct filesystem sizes are displayed by df.
But the directory mnt disappears on a subsequent ls. A "sudo umount /Users/jks/mnt"
restores the directory.

We were able to use nfs instead:
Follow the instructions above for setting up nfs. Be sure to use "resvport" in the
mount command. Set the environment variable KIWI_XC_REMOTE_FS if a mount point other
than the default is used.

But note that NFS has its own problem: it doesn't see special files from the Kiwi /proc directory.
This keeps the BeagleBone device auto-detection code in Makefile.comp.inc from working.
So for a BeagleBone AI or AI-64 device you must set the choice manually in Makefile.comp.inc
(e.g. "BBAI_64 := true" or "BBAI := true") If neither is set BBG/BBB will be used by default
or RPi if it is detected (RPi uses a method not based on /proc).

6. Now "make xc" described above should work.
